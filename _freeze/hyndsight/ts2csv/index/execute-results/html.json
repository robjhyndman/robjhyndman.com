Then you may need to export some data from R via a csv file. When the data is stored as a `ts` object, the time index can easily get lost. So I wrote a little function to make this easier, using the `tsibble` package to do almost all of the work in looking after the time index. (Thanks to Earo in the comments for greatly simplifying my original code.)\n\n```r\n# Convert time series data to csv\nts2csv <- function(x) {\n  fname <- paste0(deparse(substitute(x)), \".csv\")\n  readr::write_csv(tsibble::as_tsibble(x, gather = FALSE), fname)\n}\n\nlibrary(fpp2)\nts2csv(auscafe)    # Univariate monthly data\nts2csv(visnights)  # Multivariate quarterly data\nts2csv(elecdemand) # Multivariate half-hourly data\n```\n\n",
