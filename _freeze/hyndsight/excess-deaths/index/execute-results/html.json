One way to explore the true mortality effect of the pandemic is to look at \"excess deaths\" --- the difference between death rates this year and the same time in previous years.\n\nThe [*Financial Times*](http://ft.com/coronavirus-latest) (and other media outlets) have been collecting data from many countries to try to measure this effect. Now the [Human Mortality Database](https://www.mortality.org/) has made this much easier by publishing weekly deaths data for 13 countries.\n\nUnfortunately, many countries do not have the processes in place to allow such data to be readily available. In Australia, for example, the [most recent official deaths data](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/mf/3302.0) is from 2018! The fact that there is no public organized national data collection for deaths during a pandemic is a sad indictment on the responsible government authorities.\n\n## Download the data\n\nHere is some code to download and organize the data from the HMD\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstmf <- readr::read_csv(\"https://www.mortality.org/Public/STMF/Outputs/stmf.csv\", skip=1)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstmf\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 29,994 × 19\n   CountryCode  Year  Week Sex   D0_14 D15_64 D65_74 D75_84  D85p DTotal\n   <chr>       <dbl> <dbl> <chr> <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl>\n 1 AUT          2000     1 m      6.28   184.   211.   237.  176.    814\n 2 AUT          2000     1 f      5.35   101.   141.   335.  471.   1053\n 3 AUT          2000     1 b     11.5    285.   355.   573.  643.   1867\n 4 AUT          2000     2 m      6.58   192.   217.   244.  180.    840\n 5 AUT          2000     2 f      5.81   109.   141.   335.  471.   1062\n 6 AUT          2000     2 b     12.2    302.   359.   580.  650.   1902\n 7 AUT          2000     3 m      7.73   226.   220.   248.  183.    886\n 8 AUT          2000     3 f      6.11   115.   152.   361.  507.   1141\n 9 AUT          2000     3 b     13.8    341.   378.   610.  684.   2027\n10 AUT          2000     4 m      7.30   214.   217.   245.  181.    864\n# … with 29,984 more rows, and 9 more variables: R0_14 <dbl>,\n#   R15_64 <dbl>, R65_74 <dbl>, R75_84 <dbl>, R85p <dbl>, RTotal <dbl>,\n#   Split <dbl>, SplitSex <dbl>, Forecast <dbl>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe columns beginning with `D` show deaths for different age groups, while mortality rates are in the columns starting with `R`.\n\n## Wrangle the data into long form\n\nLet's drop the rates columns and wrangle it into a form more suitable for analysis.

These are due to incomplete counts as noted in the [meta data provided by HMD](https://www.mortality.org/File/GetDocument/Public/STMF_DOC/STMFmetadata.pdf), and the same problem may affect other countries too. As more data are made available, earlier weeks may also be updated.\n\nNote that there is a lag before the data are made available.

The other years help to see the natural variability in this calculation. Interestingly, many countries have negative excess deaths for the first 10 weeks of the year, probably due to precautions being taken before the virus had spread. So there were fewer car accidents, for example.\n\nI'm fairly sure the numbers for the United States in the last week shown above are also incorrect, as the official COVID19 deaths have not stopped decreasing, but the data will presumably get corrected over time.\n\nFinally, we can summarise the total excess deaths per country for 2020.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexcess_deaths %>%\n  filter(year==2020) %>%\n  group_by(country) %>%\n  summarise(\n    excess = sum(excess),\n    last_week = max(week),\n    as_at = as.Date(\"2020-01-01\") + 7*(last_week-1)\n  ) %>%\n  select(country, excess, as_at)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 13 × 3\n   country         excess as_at     \n   <chr>            <dbl> <date>    \n 1 Austria          -204  2020-03-25\n 2 Belgium          6322  2020-04-29\n 3 Denmark          -485  2020-04-15\n 4 England & Wales 33581  2020-04-22\n 5 Finland          -260  2020-04-22\n 6 Germany          -602. 2020-04-08\n 7 Iceland             5  2020-04-01\n 8 Netherlands      4670  2020-04-08\n 9 Norway           -558  2020-04-15\n10 Portugal         -168  2020-04-22\n11 Spain           19530  2020-04-29\n12 Sweden           1227  2020-04-22\n13 United States    8457  2020-04-15\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n  * Some countries have negative excess deaths, due to early interventions.\n  * The numbers for England & Wales and the United States are substantially lower than what the [*Financial Times*](http://ft.com/coronavirus-latest) is estimating, probably due to the available data.
