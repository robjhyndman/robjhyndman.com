Thanks to Maximilian Muecke for helping with this release, and for modernising some of the old code.\n\nHere are the main new features and changes.\n\n\n\n## New forecasting models\n\nThe usual workflow with the forecast package is to fit a model to a time series, and then forecast from the model. For example\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nUSAccDeaths |> ets() |> forecast()\nUSAccDeaths |> auto.arima() |> forecast()\n```\n:::\n\n\nBut there have always been a few functions that produce forecasts directly from a time series, without the need to explicitly fit a model first. For example, \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nUSAccDeaths |> snaive()\n```\n:::\n\n\nproduces seasonal naive forecasts.\n\nBut now you can obtain the same forecasts by first fitting a model and then forecasting from it:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nUSAccDeaths |> rw_model(lag = 12) |> forecast()\n```\n:::\n\n\nSimilarly, you can now fit and forecast from mean models, cubic spline models, theta models, and Croston's method using the new `mean_model()`, `spline_model()`, `theta_model()`, and `croston_model()` functions. The existing `naive()`, `snaive()`, `rwf`, `meanf()`, `splinef()`, `thetaf()`, and `croston()` functions are still available for backward compatibility, but are now merely wrappers around the modelling and `forecast` functions.\n\nThis should make it easier to set up forecasting workflows involving many different models. For example, suppose you wanted to compute forecasts from five different models applied to the `USAccDeaths` time series.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(purrr)\nmodel_fns <- list(ets, auto.arima, rw_model, rw_model, mean_model)\nargs <- vector(\"list\", length(model_fns))\nargs[[3]] <- list(lag = 12)\nargs[[4]] <- list(lag = 12, drift = TRUE)\nmodels <- map2(model_fns, args, ~ do.call(.x, c(list(y=USAccDeaths), .y)))\nnames(models) <- map(models, function(u) u$method)\nforecasts <- map(models, forecast)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNote that `rw_model` is included twice, with different arguments, allowing the calculation of seasonal naive, and seasonal naive with drift, forecasts.\n\nForecasting with multiple models is easy to do using the [`fable` package](https://fable.tidyverts.org/) (and was one of the key considerations in its design). Now it is also possible to do it using the `forecast` package, with this more consistent interface.\n\n## Missing values in ETS models\n\nI wrote the first version of the ETS code (more than 25 years ago) for a consulting project where there were no missing values, so I didn't write the code to handle them. But obviously missing values occur a lot in many applications, and I've now belatedly added support for them. If there are gaps in a time series, `ets()` can be applied, and it computes the likelihood and fitted values correctly using all available data. (Previously, it would fit a model to the largest contiguous segment of the data.)\n\nThis change has also been made to the `ETS()` function in the  [`fable` package](https://fable.tidyverts.org/).\n\n## Bootstrapped prediction intervals\n\nThe default prediction intervals in the forecast package are based on the (usually reasonable) assumption that forecast errors are Gaussian. \nBootstrapped prediction intervals allow for non-Gaussian forecast errors. These have long been available using ETS, ARIMA, and other models; they are now also available using ARFIMA and TBATS models. \n\n## Other changes\n\n* Added parallelization for `nnetar()`.\n* More consistent handling of the `biasadj` argument across models.\n* More consistent interface for simulated and bootstrapped prediction intervals for all models.\n* Bug fixes and performance improvements.\n* Documentation improvements.\n\n## Future of the forecast package\n\nI would still encourage people to use the [`fable` package](https://fable.tidyverts.org/) for new projects, as it provides a more modern and consistent interface for time series forecasting in R. However, the `forecast` package will continue to be maintained, with bug fixes and minor improvements as needed.",
