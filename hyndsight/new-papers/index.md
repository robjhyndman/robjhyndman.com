Many people ask me to let them know when I write a new research paper. I can't do that as there are too many people involved, and it is not scalable.

The solution is simple. Take your pick from the following options. Each is automatic and will let you know whenever I produce a new paper.



  1. [Subscribe to the rss feed](https://robjhyndman.com/index.xml) on my website using [feedly](http://feedly.com), [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/), or some other rss reader.

  2. [Subscribe to new papers via email](https://robjhyndman.com/subscribe.html).

  3. Go to my [Google scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vamErfkAAAAJ&hl=en) and click "Follow" at the top of the page.

The latter method will work for anyone with a Google scholar page. The Google scholar option only includes research papers. The first two methods also include any new seminars I give or new software packages I write.
