At the IIF annual board meeting last month in Rotterdam, I suggested that we provide awards to the top students studying forecasting at university level around the world, to the tune of $100 plus IIF membership for a year. I'm delighted that the idea met with enthusiasm, and that the [awards are now available](https://forecasters.org/programs/research-awards/students/). Even better, my [second year forecasting subject](http://www.monash.edu/pubs/2014handbooks/units/ETC2450.html) has been approved for an award.

The IIF have agreed to fund awards for 20 forecasting courses to start with. I believe they have already had severalÂ applications, so any other forecasting lecturers out there will need to be quick if they want to be part of it.
