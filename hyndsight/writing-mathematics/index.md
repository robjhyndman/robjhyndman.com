Mathematics has its own particular conventions and rules when it comes to writing. There have been several attempts to write them down. The most famous is Halmos's excellent essay ["How to write mathematics"](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~brd/Advice/halmos.pdf). Other good sources of advice are the following two books:

(I [reviewed these two books](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-842X.00078) in the _Australian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics_ a few years ago.)

But if you just want a quick summary, I recommend Dave Richeson's blog entry ["The nuts and bolts of writing mathematics"](http://divisbyzero.com/2009/09/17/the-nuts-and-bolts-of-writing-mathematics-2/).
