[I've written briefly on this before](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/referee-reports/). For an excellent and more detailed discussion of what is involved, there is a series of excellent posts on [Pat Thomson's blog](http://patthomson.wordpress.com/):


  1. [Refereeing a journal article part 1: reading](http://patthomson.wordpress.com/2012/01/07/refereeing-a-journal-article-part-1-reading/)

  2. [Refereeing a journal article part 2: making a recommendation](http://patthomson.wordpress.com/2012/01/13/refereeing-a-journal-article-part-2-making-a-recommendation/)

  3. [Refereeing a journal article part 3: writing the feedback](http://patthomson.wordpress.com/2012/01/19/refereeing-a-journal-article-part-3-writing-the-feedback/)

If every reviewer followed her advice, my life as an editor would be much easier, and the quality of research would be improved.
