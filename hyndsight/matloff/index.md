excerpt: This is a gem of a book. It will become the book I give PhD students when
  they are learning how to write good R code. That is, if I ever see it again. I had
  hoped to write a review of it, but I haven't seen it since it arrived in the mail
  a couple of weeks ago because a research student or research assistant has always
  had it on loan. I guess that's a testament to how useful it is.

At less then $25, you have little to lose -- [head over to Amazon and buy a copy now](http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=140570\&GR_URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2F1593273843)! If a few of my PhD students buy their own copies, I might get mine back.
