Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman's [_Elements of Statistical Learning_](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) first appeared in 2001 and is already a classic. It is my go-to book when I need a quick refresher on a machine learning algorithm. I like it because it is written using the language and perspective of statistics, and provides a very useful entry point into the literature of machine learning which has its own terminology for statistical concepts. A [free downloadable pdf version](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/download.html) is available on the website.

Recently, a simpler related book appeared entitled [_Introduction to Statistical Learning with applications in R_](http://www.statlearning.com/) by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani. It "is aimed for upper level undergraduate students, masters students and Ph.D. students in the non-mathematical sciences". This would be a great textbook for our new 3rd year subject on Business Analytics. The R code is a welcome addition in showing how to implement the methods. Again, a [free downloadable pdf version](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf) is available on the website.

Thanks to the authors for being willing to make these books freely available.
