About six weeks ago, [I proposed](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/stackexchange/) that there should be a Stack Exchange site for questions on data analysis, statistics, data mining, machine learning, etc. I can finally report that there has been substantial progress on this.

The formal proposal is now at [Area 51](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/33/statistical-analysis) where the scope of the new site is being developed and voted on in a democratic way. The site has been in a private beta state for a week or so, but is now open for anyone to join in.

So if you're interested in this proposed site for questions/answers on statistical analysis, please head over to [Area 51](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/33/statistical-analysis) and join in the discussion and voting on what the site should cover. It would be a good idea to first read the [FAQ](http://area51.stackexchange.com/faq) so you understand how the system works.
