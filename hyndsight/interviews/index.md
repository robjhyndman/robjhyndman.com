I've been interviewed twice in the last year:


  * For [DecisionStats](http://www.decisionstats.com/interview-rob-j-hyndman-forecasting-expert-rstats/), 9 August 2012.

  * For [Data Mining Research](http://www.dataminingblog.com/data-mining-interview-rob-hyndman/), 21 October 2011. Republished inÂ [_Amstat News_](http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2011/12/01/qasitedec11/), 1 December 2011.

Some readers of this blog might find them interesting. I said a few things in today's interview that I don't think I've previously said publicly.
