We are still looking for a few more invited sessions for the International Symposium on Forecasting, to be held in Cairns, Australia, 25-28 June 2017.<!-- more -->

An invited session consists of 3 or 4 talks around a specific, forecasting theme. You are allowed to be one of the speakers in a session you organize (although it is not necessary). Therefore, if you know what you are planning to speak about, all you need to do is find 2 or 3 other speakers who will speak on a related topic, and invite them. The length of all such invited talks will be about 20 minutes.

Organizers of invited sessions will be acknowledged separately in the program and invited sessions will be marked as such. These carry a slightly higher status than a contributed session. Unfortunately, we can't offer any financial support for these invited speakers or session organizers.

Today is the deadline for submitting an invited session, but we will consider submissions for the next couple of weeks.

Send your proposals to [Pam Stroud](mailto:pamstroud@forecasters.org?subject=ISF%202017%20-%20Organized%20Session) including the following information:



  * Session theme

  * Speaker names, affiliations, and title for their talk
