I've written about [taking a break](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/take-a-break/) from research before. Along the same lines, there is some good advice on "[The Importance of Making Time for "Real World" Activities in Grad School](http://mathgradblog.williams.edu/the-importance-of-making-time-for-real-world-activities-in-grad-school/)" over at the excellent [AMS Graduate Student Blog](http://mathgradblog.williams.edu/).
