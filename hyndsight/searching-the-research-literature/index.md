Most students seem to go to Google first. This is not a good strategy. Google Scholar is much better as it filters out all the junk. Scopus is another engine that aims to do a similar thing. It is better organized but not so complete. ISI WOK is also not as complete as Google Scholar but is particularly good at tracking citations.

  * [Google scholar](http://scholar.google.com/)
  * [Scopus](http://www.scopus.com/home.url)
  * [ISI Web of Knowledge](http://isiwebofknowledge.com/)

If you track down something on Google scholar, but are at home and so do not have access to the paper, you can use [Monash](javascript:void(location.href=%22https://go.openathens.net/redirector/www.monash.edu?url=%22+location.href)). Just drag the previous link to your bookmarks. When you are on the page of a paper you want, click the link and it will ask for your usual Monash username/password, after which you should be able to access the paper.

Sometimes, a more restrictive search is needed. Try one of these:

  * Statistics papers: [Current Index to Statistics](https://mathscinet.ams.org/cis)
  * Statistical books: [My Google library](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/searching-the-statistical-literature/)
  * Econometrics papers: [IDEAS/RePEc](http://ideas.repec.org/)
  * Computing papers: [CiteSeer](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/)
  * Mathematics papers: [MathSciNet](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search.html)
  * Health Science papers: [PubMed](http://www.hubmed.org).

Finally, if you've still had no luck, then try [Google](http://www.google.com/).

If you know the paper you are after, it is often better to go through the [Monash library](https://www.monash.edu/library).

**Notes:**

  * A few of these links require a licence to access them. All of them can be accessed from Monash computers.
  * You don't need to search JSTOR separately as it is covered by Google scholar.
  * RePEc is covered by both Scopus and Google Scholar
