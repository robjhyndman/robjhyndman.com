I don't go to many meetings as I find they are largely a waste of time. In fact, I have the following poster on my office wall to remind everyone who walks in not to ask me to attend a meeting!

But I'm now a chief investigator of an NHMRC grant and I have to meet with other members of the team from time to time. We've started using [Doodle](http://www.doodle.com) to schedule our meetings, and it is so good I thought I should share it.

[Doodle](http://www.doodle.com) is a cloud-based way to schedule a meeting (or any event). Here is how it works.


  1. The person organizing the meeting selects some potential times and dates on [Doodle](http://www.doodle.com), and then sends an email to all participants with a link to a page where they can register their availability.

  2. Each person who receives the email clicks on the link and adds their availability to each of the possible times/dates.

  3. The meeting organizer can then see a simple table showing when the best time for the meeting is.

This simple procedure saves a lot of emails and phone calls trying to sort out the best time.

I've since discovered some other web-services that are similar. The best of these seems to be [ScheduleOnce](http://www.scheduleonce.com/#oid=1010_3) -- I'll be using it from now on. Of course, I'd still rather not go to any meetings, but if it is really necessary, using [ScheduleOnce](http://www.scheduleonce.com/#oid=1010_3) saves some time in scheduling when the meeting should be held.
