One of the great services of the Statistical Society of Australia is [an excellent **jobs board**](http://careers.statsoc.org.au) advertising available jobs for statisticians, data analysts, data scientists, etc. Jobs can be filtered by industry, location and job function.

Today the SSA announced a new service to job seekers: CV/Resume Critique.<!-- more -->

Within 48 hours of opt-in, an email will be sent to you outlining your strengths, weaknesses and suggestions to ensure you have the best chance of getting interviewed!
