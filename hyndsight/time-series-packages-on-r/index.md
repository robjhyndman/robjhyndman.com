There is now an official [CRAN Task View for Time Series](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html). This will replace my earlier list of time series packages for R, and provide a more visible and useful entry point for people wanting to use R for time series analysis. If I have missed anything on the list, please let me know.
