I gave this talk on **_[Forecasting time series using R](http://www.meetup.com/MelbURN-Melbourne-Users-of-R-Network/events/30544191/)_** for the [Melbourne Users of R Network (MelbURN)](http://www.meetup.com/MelbURN-Melbourne-Users-of-R-Network/) on Thursday 27 October 2011.

**Abstract**
I look at the various facilities for time series forecasting available in R, concentrating on the [forecast](http://github.com/robjhyndman/forecast/) package. This package implements several automatic methods for forecasting time series including forecasts from ARIMA models, ARFIMA models and exponential smoothing models. I also look more generally at how to go about forecasting non-seasonal data, seasonal data, seasonal data with high frequency, and seasonal data with multiple frequencies. Examples are taken from my own consulting experience. I give an overview of what's possible and available and where it is useful, rather than give the mathematical details of any specific time series methods.
