Professor [Tao Hong](http://www.drhongtao.com/) has generously funded a new prize for the best IJF paper on energy forecasting, to be awarded every two years. The first award will be for papers published in the International Journal of Forecasting during the period 2013-2014. The prize will be US$1000 plus an engraved plaque. The award committee is [Rob J Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com), [Pierre Pinson](http://pierrepinson.com/) and [James Mitchell](https://www.wbs.ac.uk/about/person/james-mitchell).

Nominations are invited from any reader of the IJF. Each person may nominate up to three papers, but you cannot nominate a paper that you have coauthored yourself. Papers coauthored by Tao Hong or one of the award committee are not eligible for the prize. All nominations are to be accompanied by a short statement (up to 200 words) from the nominator, explaining why the paper deserves an award.

You can see the relevant papers published in the period 2013-2014 on [Google Scholar](https://goo.gl/qOYWnC). Of course, a good paper does not always get noticed, so don’t let the citation count sway you too much in nominating what you consider to be the best IJF paper from this period.

Nominations should be [sent to me by email](mailto:ijf@forecasters.org) by **8 February 2017**.
