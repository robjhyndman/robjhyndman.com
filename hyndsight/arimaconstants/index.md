A non-seasonal ARIMA model can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:c}
(1-\phi_1B - \cdots - \phi_p B^p)(1-B)^d y_t = c + (1 + \theta_1 B + \cdots + \theta_q B^q)e_t
\end{equation}
or equivalently as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mu}
(1-\phi_1B - \cdots - \phi_p B^p)(1-B)^d (y_t - \mu t^d/d!) = (1 + \theta_1 B + \cdots + \theta_q B^q)e_t,
\end{equation}
where $B$ is the backshift operator, $c = \mu(1-\phi_1 - \cdots - \phi_p )$ and $\mu$ is the mean of $(1-B)^d y_t$. R uses the parametrization of the second equation.<!-- more -->

Thus, the inclusion of a constant in a non-stationary ARIMA model is equivalent to inducing a polynomial trend of order $d$ in the forecast function. (If the constant is omitted, the forecast function includes a polynomial trend of order $d-1$.) When $d=0$, we have the special case that $\mu$ is the mean of $y_t$.

### Including constants in ARIMA models using R


#### arima()

By default, the `arima()` command in R sets $c=\mu=0$ when $d>0$ and provides an estimate of $\mu$ when $d=0$. The parameter $\mu$ is called the “intercept” in the R output. It will be close to the sample mean of the time series, but usually not identical to it as the sample mean is not the maximum likelihood estimate when $p+q>0$.

The `arima()` command has an argument `include.mean` which only has an effect when $d=0$ and is `TRUE` by default. Setting `include.mean=FALSE` will force $\mu=0$.

#### Arima()

The `Arima()` command from the forecast package provides more flexibility on the inclusion of a constant. It has an argument `include.mean` which has identical functionality to the corresponding argument for `arima()`. It also has an argument `include.drift` which allows $\mu\ne0$ when $d=1$. For $d>1$, no constant is allowed as a quadratic or higher order trend is particularly dangerous when forecasting. The parameter $\mu$ is called the “drift” in the R output when $d=1$.

There is also an argument `include.constant` which, if `TRUE`, will set `include.mean=TRUE` if $d=0$ and `include.drift=TRUE` when $d=1$. If `include.constant=FALSE`, both `include.mean` and `include.drift` will be set to `FALSE`. If `include.constant` is used, the values of `include.mean=TRUE` and `include.drift=TRUE` are ignored.

When $d=0$ and `include.drift=TRUE`, the fitted model from `Arima()` is $$(1-\phi_1B - \cdots - \phi_p B^p) (y_t - a - bt) = (1 + \theta_1 B + \cdots + \theta_q B^q)e_t.
$$
In this case, the R output will label $a$ as the "intercept" and $b$ as the "drift" coefficient.

#### auto.arima()

The `auto.arima()` function automates the inclusion of a constant. By default, for $d=0$ or $d=1$, a constant will be included if it improves the AIC value; for $d>1$ the constant is always omitted. If `allowdrift=FALSE` is specified, then the constant is only allowed when $d=0$.

### Eventual forecast functions

The eventual forecast function (EFF) is the limit of $\hat{y}_{t+h|t}$ as a function of the forecast horizon $h$ as $h\rightarrow\infty$.

The constant $c$ has an important effect on the long-term forecasts obtained from these models.


  * If $c=0$ and $d=0$, the EFF will go to zero.

  * If $c=0$ and $d=1$, the EFF will go to a non-zero constant determined by the last few observations.

  * If $c=0$ and $d=2$, the EFF will follow a straight line with intercept and slope determined by the last few observations.

  * If $c\ne0$ and $d=0$, the EFF will go to the mean of the data.

  * If $c\ne0$ and $d=1$, the EFF will follow a straight line with slope equal to the mean of the differenced data.

  * If $c\ne0$ and $d=2$, the EFF will follow a quadratic trend.


### Seasonal ARIMA models

If a seasonal model is used, all of the above will hold with $d$ replaced by $d+D$ where $D$ is the order of seasonal differencing and $d$ is the order of non-seasonal differencing.
