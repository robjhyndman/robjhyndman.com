This is only directly relevant to my Monash students and colleagues, but the same idea might be useful for adapting to other institutions.

Some recent changes in the rmarkdown and bookdown packages mean that it is now possible to produce working papers in exactly the same format as we previously used with LaTeX.<!-- more -->

Just install the [MonashEBSTemplates](https://github.com/robjhyndman/MonashEBSTemplates) package from github. You also need a recent version of LaTeX.

Then from within RStudio, create a new document by selecting "Rmarkdown", "From Template", and select "Monash EBS Working Paper".
