The annual [Melbourne Data Science Initiative](http://www.datasciencemelbourne.com/medascin2018/) (or MeDaScIn, pronounced medicine) is on again next month (24-27 September) with lots of tutorials, and the annual datathon.

This year there will be a ["Forecasting with R"](http://www.datasciencemelbourne.com/medascin2018/session/forecasting/) workshop (25 September) led my two of my Monash colleagues -- George Athanasopoulos and Elena Sanina.

Another great tutorial will be led by Steph Kovalchik (from Tennis Australia) on [sports analytics with R](http://www.datasciencemelbourne.com/medascin2018/session/sports-analytics-with-r/) (24 September).

For the full list of tutorials, see [the MeDaScIn website](http://www.datasciencemelbourne.com/medascin2018/).
