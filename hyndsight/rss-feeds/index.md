I've now resurrected the collection of research journals that I follow, and set it up as a [shared collection in feedly](https://feedly.com/robjhyndman/Statistics%20Journals). So anyone can easily subscribe to all of the same journals, or select a subset of them, to follow on [feedly](http://feedly.com).<!-- more -->

There are about 90 journals on the list, mostly in statistics, but some from machine learning, operations research and econometrics. I excluded probability journals, and areas of application that are well outside my research interests (such as bioinformatics, psychology and pharmacology). But I included every statistical methodology journal that was rated [A, A* or B by the Australian ERA exercise in 2010](https://www.righttoknow.org.au/request/616/response/2048/attach/3/2010%20Final%20Journal%20List%20100310%20FOR%20WEBSITE.xls?cookie_passthrough=1), and several of the C journals as well (including, of course, the grossly under-rated _[Journal of Statistical Software](http://www.jstatsoft.org/)_). I also included the good new journals that have appeared since then including _[Annual Reviews](http://www.annualreviews.org/journal/statistics)_ and _[Statistics & Public Policy](http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/uspp20)_. I included the best regional journals (including _ANZJS_, _Statistica Neerlandica_, _Canadian J Statistics_, _Scandinavian J. Statistics_, and _J. Korean Statistical Society_). The two forecasting journals are on the list of course, plus the four A* journals and a couple of A journals in econometrics. Finally, I included the best machine learning, data mining, and operations research journals -- as rated on the ERA 2010 list.

Where possible, I use the "new articles" feed so that articles appear as soon they are online rather than after they appear in print. Some publishers seem to be stuck in the print era, and only provide a feed for articles in print.

Unfortunately, some of the publishers also make it difficult to get the appropriate RSS feed from the journal website. Wiley is great -- requiring just one click from the front page of the journal. Springer requires two clicks if you know where to look. Elsevier has an appalling procedure requiring about 5 or 6 clicks, and when you finally get the feed into feedly, the title is wrong (every journal becomes "ScienceDirect Publications"). Some publishers had the feed hidden so deep that they clearly don't want anyone using it.

My final beef with the publishers, is that they occasionally change the RSS feeds without warning, and then the system breaks. I spent several hours fixing up my feeds because Springer and Elsevier went and broke things that previously worked.

In addition to the journal feeds, I have also included in the collection any new working papers that appear in the [Statistics section of arXiv](http://arxiv.org/archive/stat), plus any new forecasting papers that appear on RePEc (in the [NEP-FOR report](http://nep.repec.org/nep-for.html)).

Thanks to feedly for allowing me to publish this as a ["feedly collection"](https://feedly.com/robjhyndman/Statistics%20Journals). This is a new feature in feedly that is not yet available to all users, but I was given advanced access in order to demonstrate how it could be used.
