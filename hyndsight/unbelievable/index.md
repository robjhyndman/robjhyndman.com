This is a very different book from my usual areas of forecasting and statistics. It is a personal memoir describing my journey of deconversion from Christianity.

Until a few years ago, I was regularly speaking at church conferences internationally, and my books are still used in Bible classes and Sunday Schools around the world. I even helped establish an innovative new church, which became a model for similar churches in other countries. Eventually I came to the view that I was mistaken, and that there was little or no evidence that the Bible was inspired or that God exists. In this book, I reflect on how I was fooled, and why I changed my mind.

The whole book is freely [available online](/unbelievable/). But if you prefer a print or offline version, you can buy a copy via one of the links below.
