Every day I receive emails, or comments on this blog, asking for help with R, forecasting, LaTeX, possible research topics, how to install software, or some other thing I'm supposed to know something about. Unfortunately, I cannot provide a one-man help service to the rest of the world. I used to reply to all the requests explaining where to go for help, but I stopped replying a while ago as it took too much time to do even that.

If you want help, please ask at either [stats.stackexchange.com](http://stats.stackexchange.com) (for R or statistics questions) or [tex.stackexchange.com](http://tex.stackexchange.com) (for LaTeX questions).

Unless you are one of my students, the _only_ questions I will answer are ones that concern my R packages or research papers. And even then, I won't reply if the answer is in the help files. I write those help files for a reason, so please read them.

I'm sorry I can't do more, but if I did everything people ask me to do, I'd never write any papers or produce any R packages, and I think that's a better use of my time.
