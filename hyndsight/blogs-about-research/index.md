I've created [a bundle](http://www.google.com/reader/bundle/user%2F15350839325370906198%2Fbundle%2Fresearch) so you can [subscribe to all of these in one go](http://www.google.com/reader/bundle/user%2F15350839325370906198%2Fbundle%2Fresearch).

Of course, there are [lots of statistics blogs](http://academicblogs.org/index.php?title=Mathematics/Statistics#Statistics_.28math.ST.29) as well, and [blogs about other research disciplines](http://www.academicblogs.org). The ones above are those that concentrate on generic research issues.
