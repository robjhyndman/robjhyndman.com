Today I gave a workshop for supervisors of postgraduate students. Mostly I talked about creating a team environment for postgraduate students rather than the traditional model (at least in statistics and econometrics) of each student working in isolation.

The slides are available here in [presentation form](https://robjhyndman.com/talks/HDR_teams.pdf) or in [handout form](https://robjhyndman.com/talks/HDRworkshop.pdf). Actually, these are an edited version of the slides as I accidentally left out a couple of the photographs in the workshop, and I've omitted slides that I didn't end up covering in the workshop.

An important part of my research group is this blog. So if you haven't been here before, please take a look around.

For those people who attended, feel free to add comments below if you would like to provide feedback on the workshop.
