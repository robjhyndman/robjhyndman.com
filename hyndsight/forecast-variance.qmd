description: There is sometimes confusion between "forecast variance" and "forecast error variance". In fact, they are the same thing.

Suppose we have a probabilistic forecast with estimated mean $\hat{\mu}_{T+h|T}$ and estimated variance $\hat{V}_{T+h|T}$.  That is, our estimated distribution of the future observation $y_{T+h}$, based on the data $y_1,\dots,y_T$, has mean $\hat{\mu}_{T+h|T}$ and variance $\hat{V}_{T+h|T}$. The **forecast variance** refers to $\hat{V}_{T+h|T}$, the estimated variance of the forecast distribution.

Now let our point forecast be denoted by $\hat{y}_{T+h|T}$. In most cases, the point forecast is the mean of the forecast distribution, i.e., $\hat{y}_{T+h|T} = \hat{\mu}_{T+h|T}$; but occasionally it might the median, or some other quantity.

The **forecast error variance** refers to the variance of the forecast error, i.e., $\text{Var}(y_{T+h} - \hat{y}_{T+h|T})$. Ignoring any estimation error, this is clearly the same thing as the $\hat{V}_{T+h|T}$, regardless of whether the point forecast is the mean of the forecast distribution or not.

Occasionally I see the term "forecast variance" used to mean $\text{Var}(\hat{y}_{T+h|T})$; i.e., the variance of the point forecast estimate. However, that quantity is rarely of interest to a forecaster --- we are usually interested in the distribution of a future observation, not in the distribution of the point forecast estimate.
