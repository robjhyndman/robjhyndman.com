Invitations to write for bogus journals and speak at bogus conferences keep rolling in. Here is one I received today.

> Dear Dr. Rob J. Hyndman,
> It is our great pleasure to welcome you to join in **Part 2: Knowledge Economy Symposium** of GCKE-2017, which will be held in Qingdao, China during September 19-21, 2017. And we cordially invite you to propose a Speech on your recent research of **Corrigendum to: “Hierarchical forecasts for Australian domestic tourism” [International Journal of Forecasting 25 (2009) 146–166]**... . Your prompt reply with a speech proposal (Speech Title and abstract preferred along with full CV) will be highly appreciated!

That particularly exciting piece of research is [freely available here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207014001113). I'm trying to imagine how I could expand it into a full talk.
