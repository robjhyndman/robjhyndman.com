### [ISEA2017](http://www.drhongtao.com/isea)


This will be a great conference, and it is in a great location --- Cairns, Australia, right by the Great Barrier Reef. Even better, if you stay on you can attend the **International Symposium on Forecasting** which immediately follows the **International Symposium on Energy Analytics**.

This symposium aims at bringing forecasting experts and practitioners together to share experiences and best practices on a wide range of important business problems in the energy industry. Here the energy industry broadly covers utilities, oil, gas and mining industries. The subjects to be forecasted range from supply, demand and price, to asset/system condition and customer count. The topics of interest include but are not limited to:


  * Probabilistic energy forecasting

  * Hierarchical energy forecasting

  * High-dimensional energy forecasting

  * High-frequency and high-resolution energy forecasting

  * Equipment failure prediction

  * Power systems fault prediction

  * Automatic outlier detection

  * Load profiling

  * Customer segmentation
