The [Overseas Development Institute Fellowship Scheme](http://www.odi.org/fellowship-scheme) sends young postgraduate statisticians (and economists) to work in the public sectors of developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific on two-year contracts. This is a great way to develop skills and gain experience working within a developing country's government. And you get to live in a fascinatingÂ place!

Essential criteria:



  * degree in statistics, economics, or a related field

  * postgraduate degree qualification

  * ability to commit to a two-year assignment

Application is via the [online application form](https://jobs.odi.org.uk/VacancyInformation.aspx?VId=24469).
