Last week, [Google books](http://books.google.com/) introduced a facility whereby users can [create their own "library"](http://books.google.com/googlebooks/mylibrary/) containing a subset of books to search. I have set up a [library of statistical books](http://books.google.com/books?as_list=BDbe3HukQt-_6yP735J3RARoUt7P86BEGsRz0-SRISeIwrkotMoA) to aid in searching the statistical literature.

My Google library is intended to include all the books on my office shelves, plus a whole lot more that I would like to buy if I had more money (and more shelf space). It is meant to be a collection of the best (but not all) statistics books, although I have tried to be relatively complete in some areas including forecasting, time series, statistical modelling and statistical computing. Only books that are searchable are included.

I have already found it extremely useful in tracking down that elusive reference needed for a new research paper, and I think others may find it useful too.
