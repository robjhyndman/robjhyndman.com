There's a new StackExchange site that might be useful to readers: **[Academia](http://academia.stackexchange.com/)**. It is a Q&A site for academics and those enrolled in higher education.

The draft FAQ says it will cover:


  * Life as a graduate student, postdoctoral researcher, university professor

  * Transitioning from undergraduate to graduate researcher

  * Inner workings of research departments

  * Requirements and expectations of academicians

Judging from the first 89 questions, this is going to be extremely helpful, especially for PhD students.
