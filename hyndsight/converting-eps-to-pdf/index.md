Simply include the package `epstopdf`. Then when you use pdflatex, the eps files will be automatically converted to pdf at compile time. (The conversion only happens the first time you process the file, and is skipped if there is already a pdf file with the same name.)

For example:

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{graphicx,epstopdf}
    \begin{document}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig1}
    \end{document}

Then even though the only graphics file available is `fig1.eps`, this will still be processed ok using pdflatex or pdftexify. On the first pass, a new file called `fig1-eps-coverted-to.pdf` is created and inserted at the appropriate place. See the [documentation for more options and details](https://tug.org/epstopdf/epstopdf.html).

Thanks to [Joseph Wright](http://www.texdev.net/2009/09/28/eps-graphics-with-pdflatex/) for bringing this to my attention.

Dvi is dead. Long live pdf.
