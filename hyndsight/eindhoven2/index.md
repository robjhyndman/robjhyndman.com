Last October I gave a 3-day masterclass on ["Forecasting with R"](/seminars/eindhoven) in Eindhoven, Netherlands. There is a follow-up event planned for Tuesday 18 April 2017. It is particularly designed for people who attended the 3-day class, but if anyone else wants to attend they would be welcome.
