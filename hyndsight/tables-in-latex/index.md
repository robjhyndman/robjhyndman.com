Making tables in LaTeX is one of the few areas where LaTeX can be more difficult than a WYSIWYG editor.

Here are some pointers to tools and packages that I have found useful.

  * [tablesgenerator.com](http://www.tablesgenerator.com): a web-based tool for generating LaTeX tables.

  * [Excel2LaTeX](http://ctan.org/tex-archive/support/excel2latex/): this excel add-in makes it easy to copy a rectangular array of cells in a spreadsheet into a LaTeX document.

  * [Calc2LaTeX](http://extensions.openoffice.org/en/project/calc2latex-macro-converting-openofficeorg-calc-spreadsheets-latex-tables): a similar extension for LibreOffice and OpenOffice.

  * The LaTeX wikibook has [a great page on producing tables in LaTeX](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Tables).

  * Tutorials on tables from the Indian TeX users group:

    1. [The basics](http://www.tug.org/tutorials/tugindia/chap06-scr.pdf)
    2. [Long tables](http://www.tug.org/tutorials/tugindia/chap07-scr.pdf)
    3. [Coloured tables](http://www.tug.org/tutorials/tugindia/chap08-scr.pdf)

  * The [array package](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array) for applying formatting commands to whole columns and providing additional formatting options for paragraph-like columns.

  * The [tabularx package](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/tabularx) for setting a table with fixed-width and paragraph columns with width automatically calculated.

  * The [booktabs package](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs) for providing nicer horizontal lines and better spacing control.

  * The [longtables package](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/longtable) for tables that are too big for a single page.

  * [Typesetting tables with LaTeX](https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb28-3/tb90hoeppner.pdf): a nice (and short) articleÂ covering the basics as well as the above four packages.
