I recently co-authored [a chapter on "Prospective Life Tables"](/publications/prospective-life-tables/) for this book, edited by [Arthur Charpentier](http://perso.univ-rennes1.fr/arthur.charpentier/). R code to reproduce the figures and to complete the exercises for our chapter is [available](https://robjhyndman.com/publications/prospective-life-tables/). The book can be [purchased on Amazon](http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=140570\&GR_URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2F1466592591).
