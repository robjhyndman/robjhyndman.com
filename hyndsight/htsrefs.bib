  abstract  = {Forecasting hierarchical or grouped time series using a reconciliation approach involves two steps: computing base forecasts and reconciling the forecasts. Base forecasts can be computed by popular time series forecasting methods such as exponential smoothing (ETS) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. The reconciliation step is a linear process that adjusts the base forecasts to ensure they are coherent. However, using ETS or ARIMA for base forecasts can be computationally challenging when there are a large number of series to forecast, as each model must be numerically optimized for each series. We propose a linear model that avoids this computational problem and handles the forecasting and reconciliation in a single step. The proposed method is very flexible in incorporating external data. We illustrate our approach using a dataset on monthly Australian domestic tourism, as well as a simulated dataset. We compare our approach to reconciliation using ETS and ARIMA, and show that our approach is much faster while providing similar levels of forecast accuracy.

  abstract  = {Decisions regarding the supply of electricity across a power grid must take into consideration the inherent uncertainty in demand. Optimal decision-making requires probabilistic forecasts for demand in a hierarchy with various levels of aggregation, such as substations, cities, and regions. The forecasts should be coherent in the sense that the forecast of the aggregated series should equal the sum of the forecasts of the corresponding disaggregated series. Coherency is essential, since the allocation of electricity at one level of the hierarchy relies on the appropriate amount being provided from the previous level. We introduce a new probabilistic forecasting method for a large hierarchy based on UK residential smart meter data. We find our method provides coherent and accurate probabilistic forecasts, as a result of an effective forecast combination. Furthermore, by avoiding distributional assumptions, we find that our method captures the variety of distributions in the smart meter hierarchy. Finally, the results confirm that, to ensure coherency in our large-scale hierarchy, it is sufficient to model a set of lower-dimension dependencies, rather than modeling the entire joint distribution of all series in the hierarchy. In achieving coherent and accurate hierarchical probabilistic forecasts, this work contributes to improved decision-making for smart grids.

  abstract  = {Many applications require forecasts for a hierarchy comprising a set of time series along with aggregates of subsets of these series. Hierarchical forecasting require not only good prediction accuracy at each level of the hierarchy, but also the coherency between different levels — the property that forecasts add up appropriately across the hierarchy. A fundamental limitation of prior research is the focus on forecasting the mean of each time series. We consider the situation where probabilistic forecasts are needed for each series in the hierarchy, and propose an algorithm to compute predictive distributions rather than mean forecasts only. Our algorithm has the advantage of synthesizing information from different levels in the hierarchy through a sparse forecast combination and a probabilistic hierarchical aggregation. We evaluate the accuracy of our forecasting algorithm on both simulated data and large-scale electricity smart meter data. The results show consistent performance gains compared to state-of-the art methods.}

  abstract = {Accurate electricity demand forecast plays a key role in sustainable power systems. It enables better decision making in the planning of electricity generation and distribution for many use cases. The electricity demand data can often be represented in a hierarchical structure. For example, the electricity consumption of a whole country could be disaggregated by states, cities, and households. Hierarchical forecasts require not only good prediction accuracy at each level of the hierarchy, but also the consistency between different levels. State-of-the-art hierarchical forecasting methods usually apply adjustments on the individual level forecasts to satisfy the aggregation constraints. However, the high-dimensionality of the unpenalized regression problem and the estimation errors in the high-dimensional error covariance matrix can lead to increased variability in the revised forecasts with poor prediction performance. In order to provide more robustness to estimation errors in the adjustments, we present a new hierarchical forecasting algorithm that computes sparse adjustments while still preserving the aggregation constraints. We formulate the problem as a high-dimensional penalized regression, which can be efficiently solved using cyclical coordinate descent methods. We also conduct experiments using a large-scale hierarchical electricity demand data. The results confirm the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art hierarchical forecasting methods, in both the sparsity of the adjustments and the prediction accuracy. The proposed approach to hierarchical forecasting could be useful for energy generation including solar and wind energy, as well as numerous other applications.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a three-step approach to forecasting time series of electricity consumption at different levels of household aggregation. These series are linked by hierarchical constraints—global consumption is the sum of regional consumption, for example. First, benchmark forecasts are generated for all series using generalized additive models. Second, for each series, the aggregation algorithm ML-Poly, introduced by Gaillard, Stoltz, and van Erven in 2014, finds an optimal linear combination of the benchmarks. Finally, the forecasts are projected onto a coherent subspace to ensure that the final forecasts satisfy the hierarchical constraints. By minimizing a regret criterion, we show that the aggregation and projection steps improve the root mean square error of the forecasts. Our approach is tested on household electricity consumption data; experimental results suggest that successive aggregation and projection steps improve the benchmark forecasts at different levels of household aggregation.},

  abstract  = {Forecast reconciliation is a post-forecasting process aimed to improve the quality of the base forecasts for a system of hierarchical/grouped time series (Hyndman et al., 2011). Contemporaneous (cross-sectional) and temporal hierarchies have been considered in the literature, but - except for Kourentzes and Athanasopoulos (2019) - generally these two features have not fully considered together. Adopting a notation able to simultaneously deal with both forecast reconciliation dimensions, the paper shows two new results: (i) an iterative cross-temporal forecast reconciliation procedure which extends, and overcomes some weaknesses of, the two-step procedure by Kourentzes and Athanasopoulos (2019), and (ii) the closed-form expression of the optimal (in least squares sense) point forecasts which fulfill both contemporaneous and temporal constraints. The feasibility of the proposed procedures, along with first evaluations of their performance as compared to the most performing `single dimension' (either cross-sectional or temporal) forecast reconciliation procedures, is studied through a forecasting experiment on the 95 quarterly time series of the Australian GDP from Income and Expenditure sides considered by Athanasopoulos et al.

It allows for the joint reconciliation at all forecast horizons and uses predictive distributions rather than past variation of forecast errors. Informative priors are used to assign weights to specific predictions, which makes it possible to reconcile forecasts such that they accommodate specific judgmental predictions or managerial decisions. The reconciled forecasts adhere to hierarchical constraints, which facilitates communication and supports aligned decision-making at all levels of complex hierarchical structures. An extensive forecasting study is conducted on a large collection of 13,118 time series that measure Swiss merchandise exports, grouped hierarchically by export destination and product category. We find strong evidence that in addition to producing coherent forecasts, reconciliation also leads to substantial improvements in forecast accuracy. The use of state-space methods is particularly promising for optimal decision-making under conditions with increased model uncertainty and data volatility.},

  abstract  = {A series of recent papers introduce the concept of Forecast Reconciliation, a process by which independently generated forecasts of a collection of linearly related time series are reconciled via the introduction of accounting aggregations that naturally apply to the data. Aside from its clear presentational and operational virtues, the reconciliation approach generally improves the accuracy of the combined forecasts. In this paper, we examine the mechanisms by which this improvement is generated by re-formulating the reconciliation problem as a combination of direct forecasts of each time series with additional indirect forecasts derived from the linear constraints. Our work establishes a direct link between the nascent Forecast Reconciliation literature and the extensive work on Forecast Combination. In the original hierarchical setting, our approach clarifies for the first time how unbiased forecasts for the entire collection can be generated from base forecasts made at any level of the hierarchy, and we illustrate more generally how simple robust combined forecasts can be generated in any multivariate setting subject to linear constraints. In an empirical example, we show that simple combinations of such forecasts generate significant improvements in forecast accuracy where it matters most: where noise levels are highest and the forecasting task is at its most challenging.},

In this paper we propose a new approach to hierarchical forecasting which provides optimal forecasts that are better than forecasts produced by either a top-down or a bottom-up approach. Our method is based on independently forecasting all series at all levels of the hierarchy and then using a regression model to optimally combine and reconcile these forecasts. The resulting revised forecasts add up appropriately across the hierarchy, are unbiased and have minimum variance amongst all combination forecasts under some simple assumptions. We show in a simulation study that our method performs well compared to the top-down approach and the bottom-up method. We demonstrate our proposed method by forecasting Australian tourism demand where the data are disaggregated by purpose of travel and geographical region. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is becoming increasingly relevant to many other areas, such as retailing, where at the very disaggregate level time series may be highly intermittent, but at more aggregate levels are likely to exhibit trends and seasonal patterns. The vast majority of intermittent demand forecasting methods are inappropriate for producing forecasts with such features. We propose using temporal hierarchies to produce forecasts that demonstrate these traits at the various aggregation levels, effectively informing the resulting intermittent forecasts of these patterns that are identifiable only at higher levels. We conduct an empirical evaluation on real data and demonstrate statistically significant gains for both point and quantile forecasts.},

  abstract  = {In this study, we solve a real-world intermittent demand forecasting problem for a fashion retailer in Singapore, where it has been operating retail stores and a warehouse for several decades. The demand for each stock keeping unit (SKU) at each store on each day needs to be determined to develop an effective and efficient inventory and logistics system for the retailer. The SKU-store-day demand is highly intermittent. In order to solve this challenging intermittent demand forecasting problem, we propose a greedy aggregation–decomposition method. It involves a new hierarchical forecasting structure and utilizes both aggregate and disaggregate forecasts, which differs from the classical bottom-up and top-down approach. The method is investigated on the real-world SKU-store-day demand database from this retailer in Singapore, and significantly outperforms other widely used intermittent demand forecasting methods. The proposed method also serves as a general self-improvement procedure for any intermittent time series forecasting method taking dual source of variations into account. Moreover, we introduce a revised mean absolute scaled error (RMASE) as a new accuracy measure for intermittent demand forecasting. It is a relative error measure, scale-independent, and compares with the error of zero forecasts.},

  abstract  = {We propose four different estimators that take into account the autocorrelation structure when reconciling forecasts in a temporal hierarchy. Combining forecasts from multiple temporal aggregation levels exploits information differences and mitigates model uncertainty, while reconciliation ensures a unified prediction that supports aligned decisions at different horizons. In previous studies, weights assigned to the forecasts were given by the structure of the hierarchy or the forecast error variances without considering potential autocorrelation in the forecast errors. Our first estimator considers the autocovariance matrix within each aggregation level. Since this can be difficult to estimate, we propose a second estimator that blends autocorrelation and variance information, but only requires estimation of the first-order autocorrelation coefficient at each aggregation level. Our third and fourth estimators facilitate information sharing between aggregation levels using robust estimates of the cross-correlation matrix and its inverse. We compare the proposed estimators in a simulation study and demonstrate their usefulness through an application to short-term electricity load forecasting in four price areas in Sweden. We find that by taking account of auto- and cross-covariances when reconciling forecasts, accuracy can be significantly improved uniformly across all frequencies and areas.},

In particular, a general framework is established that nests many existing popular reconciliation methods within the class of projections. This interpretation facilitates the derivation of novel theoretical results. First, reconciliation via projection is guaranteed to improve forecast accuracy with respect to a class of loss functions based on a generalised distance metric. Second, the Minimum Trace (MinT) method minimises expected loss for this same class of loss functions. Third, the geometric interpretation provides a new proof that forecast reconciliation using projections results in unbiased forecasts, provided that the initial base forecasts are also unbiased. Approaches for dealing with biased base forecasts are proposed. An extensive empirical study of Australian tourism flows demonstrates the theoretical results of the paper and shows that bias correction prior to reconciliation outperforms alternatives that only bias-correct or only reconcile forecasts.},

  abstract        = {Forecasts are often made at various levels of aggregation of individual products, which combine into groups at higher hierarchical levels. We provide an alternative to the traditional discussion of bottom-up versus top-down forecasting by examining how the hierarchy of products can be exploited when forecasts are generated. Instead of selecting series from parts of the hierarchy for forecasting, we explore the possibility of using all the series. Moreover, instead of using the hierarchy after the initial forecasts are generated, we consider the hierarchical structure as a defining feature of the data-generating process and use it to instantaneously generate forecasts for all levels of the hierarchy. This integrated approach uses a state space model and the Kalman filter to explicitly incorporate product dependencies, such as complementarity of products and product substitution, which are otherwise ignored. An empirical study shows the substantial gain in forecast and inventory performance of generalizing the bottom-up and top-down forecast approaches to an integrated approach. The integrated approach is applicable to hierarchical forecasting in general, and extends beyond the current application of demand forecasting for manufacturers.},

  abstract  = {Hierarchical forecasting has been receiving increasing attention in the literature. The notion of coherency is central to this, which implies that the hierarchical time series follows some linear aggregation constraints. This notion, however, does not take several modelling uncertainties into account. We propose to redefine coherency as stochastic. This allows to accommodate overlooked uncertainties in forecast reconciliation. We show analytically that there are two potential sources of uncertainty in forecast reconciliation. We use simulated data to demonstrate how these uncertainties propagate to the covariance matrix estimation, introducing uncertainty in the reconciliation weights matrix. This then increases the uncertainty of the reconciled forecasts. We apply our understanding to modelling accident and emergency admissions in a UK hospital. Our analysis confirms the insights from stochastic coherency in forecast reconciliation. It shows that we gain accuracy improvement from forecast reconciliation, on average, at the cost of the variability of the forecast error distribution. Users may opt to prefer less volatile error distributions to assist decision making.},

In supply chain forecasting, the Tt emphasis is primarily on the accuracy while coherency of forecasts often gets ignored. This paper proposes a novel cross-temporal forecasting framework (CTFF) to generate coherent forecasts at all levels of a retail supply chain. A deep learning method, the long-short-term-memory network, is used as the base forecasting method in the CTFF. The performance of the CTFF is evaluated on point-of-sales data from a large multi-channel retail supply chain. Through several performance metrics and statistical tests, we conclude that forecasts from the CTFF are significantly better than the direct forecasts. In addition, improvements are significant and consistent across cross-sectional and temporal levels of a supply chain. Further, it has been observed that bottom-up forecasts are more accurate than top-down forecasts when point-of-sales data is used for forecasting in online and offline retail supply chain.},

  abstract = {Forecasting often involves multiple time-series that are hierarchically organized (e.g., sales by geography). In that case, there is a constraint that the bottom level forecasts add-up to the aggregated ones. Common approaches use traditional forecasting methods to predict all levels in the hierarchy and then reconcile the forecasts to satisfy that constraint. We propose a new algorithm that automatically forecasts multiple hierarchically organized time-series. We introduce a combination of additive Gaussian processes (GPs) with a hierarchical piece-wise linear function to estimate, respectively, the stationary and non-stationary components of the time-series. We define a flexible structure of additive GPs generated by each aggregated group in the hierarchy of the data. This formulation aims to capture the nested information in the hierarchy while avoiding overfitting. We extended the piece-wise linear function to be hierarchical by defining hyperparameters shared across related time-series. From our experiments, our algorithm can estimate hundreds of time-series at once. To work at this scale, the estimation of the posterior distributions of the parameters is performed using mean-field approximation. We validate the proposed method in two different real-world datasets showing its competitiveness when compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. In summary, our method simplifies the process of hierarchical forecasting as no reconciliation is required. It is easily adapted to non-Gaussian likelihoods and multiple or non-integer seasonalities. The fact that it is a Bayesian approach makes modeling uncertainty of the forecasts trivial.},

  abstract        = {Age-specific mortality rates are often disaggregated by different attributes, such as sex, state, and ethnicity. Forecasting age-specific mortality rates at the national and sub-national levels plays an important role in developing social policy. However, independent forecasts at the sub-national levels may not add up to the forecasts at the national level. To address this issue, we consider reconciling forecasts of age-specific mortality rates, extending the methods of Hyndman et al. in 2011 to functional time series, where age is considered as a continuum. The grouped functional time series methods are used to produce point forecasts of mortality rates that are aggregated appropriately across different disaggregation factors. For evaluating forecast uncertainty, we propose a bootstrap method for reconciling interval forecasts. Using the regional age-specific mortality rates in Japan, obtained from the Japanese Mortality Database, we investigate the one- to ten-step-ahead point and interval forecast accuracies between the independent and grouped functional time series forecasting methods. The proposed methods are shown to be useful for reconciling forecasts of age-specific mortality rates at the national and sub-national levels. They also enjoy improved forecast accuracy averaged over different disaggregation factors. Supplementary materials for the article are available online.},

  abstract  = {Over the last 15 years, studies on hierarchical forecasting have moved away from single-level approaches towards proposing linear combination approaches across multiple levels of the hierarchy. Such combinations offer coherent reconciled forecasts, improved forecasting performance and aligned decision-making. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical forecasting approach based on machine learning. The proposed method allows for non-linear combinations of the base forecasts, thus being more general than linear approaches. We structurally combine the objectives of improved post-sample empirical forecasting accuracy and coherence. Due to its non-linear nature, our approach selectively combines the base forecasts in a direct and automated way without requiring that the complete information must be used for producing reconciled forecasts for each series and level. The proposed method is evaluated both in terms of accuracy and bias using two different data sets coming from the tourism and retail industries. Our results suggest that the proposed method gives superior point forecasts than existing approaches, especially when the series comprising the hierarchy are not characterized by the same patterns.},

  abstract = {Achieving high accuracy in energy consumption forecasting is critical for improving energy management and planning. However, this requires the selection of appropriate forecasting models, able to capture the individual characteristics of the series to be predicted, which is a task that involves a lot of system and region level, not only the model selection problem is expanded to multiple time series, but we also require aggregation consistency of the forecasts across levels. Although hierarchical forecasting, such as the bottom-up, the top-down, and the optimal reconciliation methods, can address the aggregation consistency concerns, it does not resolve the model selection uncertainty. To address this issue, we rely on Multiple Temporal Aggregation (MTA), which has been shown to mitigate the model selection problem for low-frequency time series. We propose a modification of the Multiple Aggregation Prediction Algorithm, a special implementation of MTA, for high-frequency time series to better handle the undesirable effect of seasonality shrinkage that MTA implies and combine it with conventional cross-sectional hierarchical forecasting. The impact of incorporating temporal aggregation in hierarchical forecasting is empirically assessed using a real data set from five bank branches. We show that the proposed MTA approach, combined with the optimal reconciliation method, demonstrates superior accuracy, aggregation consistency, and reliable automatic forecasting.},

  abstract = {Temporal hierarchies have been widely used during the past few years as they are capable to provide more accurate coherent forecasts at different planning horizons. However, they still display some limitations, being mainly subject to the forecasting methods used for generating the base forecasts and the particularities of the examined series. This paper deals with such limitations by considering three different strategies: (i) combining forecasts of multiple methods, (ii) applying bias adjustments and (iii) selectively implementing temporal hierarchies to avoid seasonal shrinkage. The proposed strategies can be applied either separately or simultaneously, being complements to the method considered for reconciling the base forecasts and completely independent from each other. Their effect is evaluated using the monthly series of the M and M3 competitions. The results are very promising, displaying lots of potential for improving the performance of temporal hierarchies, both in terms of accuracy and bias.},

  abstract  = {We are interested in forecasting a large collection of FMCG demand time series. As the demand of FMCG exists in a hierarchy (from manufacturers to distributors to retailers), the bottom level of the hierarchy may contain thousands or even millions of time series. Producing aggregate consistent forecasts while utilizing the unique features from each time series thus become a technical challenge. To achieve better forecasting results, exploratory analysis is often necessary to obtain insights on the underlying demand generating mechanism for each time series. Exploratory analysis aims at discovering those so-called «exogenous factors», such as price, demand of the complementary/substitutive goods and calendar events, which can help explain some of the demand fluctuation. During forecast accuracy evaluation, outlier detection is also important; a single anomalous time series can contribute much to the overall error. However, in a big data (such as retailing scanner data) enabled environment, exploratory analysis and visualization need much attention, because of the non-scalable nature of the existing methods. Scalability is essential for exogenous factor selection and outlier detection in big time series data. In Part I of this two-part paper, we introduce some exploratory analytics and visualization methods (from not scalable to very scalable) for big retailing time series. Forecasting of the hierarchical FMCG demand is addressed in Part II.},

  abstract = {Previously in “Reconciling solar forecasts: Geographical hierarchy” [Solar Energy 146 (2017) 276–286], we have demonstrated that by reconciling the forecasts obtained from a geographical hierarchy (formed by levels such as transmission zones, distribution nodes, PV plants, subsystems and inverters), more accurate forecasts can be obtained as compared to forecasts produced using only the information from a single level. Furthermore, these reconciled forecasts are aggregate consistent, facilitating different power system operations and power plant management. In this paper, we continue our discussion on hierarchical reconciliation and consider another type of hierarchy, namely, temporal hierarchy. A temporal hierarchy can be constructed by aggregating a high-frequency time series (e.g., hourly) into different low-frequency time series (e.g., 6-hourly and daily). While the measurements in a temporal hierarchy sum up consistently (e.g., the first two points in an hourly time series sum up to be the first point in the 2-hourly time series), the forecasts in general do not sum up, due to the different models used to generate forecasts. This inconsistency poses an apparent problem when selecting forecasts. Using reconciliation could mitigate the problem by reconciling different forecasts obtained at different timescales, and thus generating aggregate consistent forecasts. In addition, the reconciled forecasts reduce modeling uncertainties using combinations – similar to the ensemble forecasting used in numerical weather prediction (NWP) – and thus improve forecast accuracy. The empirical part of the paper consists an NWP-based day-ahead forecast reconciliation example. Hourly data from 318 sites in California, over a period of 1 year, is used. Over 50 million forecasts are produced in this paper, in an operational forecasting context. Temporal reconciliation is shown to significantly outperform NWP forecasts produced by 3TIER, with a forecast skill (computed based on 3TIER forecasts) up to 0.3. Since reconciliation does not require any additional information, such improvement is thus encouraging.},

  abstract  = {To integrate solar energy into the electricity grid reliably and efficiently, different forecasting techniques are used to produce forecasts at various forecast horizons using data of different levels of aggregation. For example, power generated by distributed photovoltaics (PV) can be disaggregated in a geographical hierarchy into transmission zones, distribution nodes, PV plants, subsystems and inverters; forecasts are required at all of these levels to facilitate different power system operations and power plant management. Due to the different information sets visible to different players in the hierarchy, such as PV plant owners and independent system operators, the forecasts produced at different aggregation levels are often not optimal. Furthermore, these forecasts are aggregate inconsistent, i.e., forecasts made using data collected at lower levels do not add up exactly to the forecasts made using higher level data. In this paper, the state-of-the-art forecast reconciliation techniques are explored. By minimizing the trace of forecast error covariance matrix, the base forecasts obtained across the hierarchy can be optimally reconciled. The reconciled forecasts not only aggregate consistently, and thus lead to collaborative decision making, but also improve the base forecasts at each level significantly. The merit of the reconciliation framework goes to the fact that it does not require any additional information other than those base forecasts. Furthermore, forecast improvements are independent of the base forecasting methods. In other words, once the base forecasts are generated with our favorite methods, the reconciliation will most likely improve those forecasts further. The reconciliation techniques can be applied to a variety of hierarchies with different forecast horizons. The empirical part of this work considers two examples, namely, an NWP-based day-ahead forecast reconciliation over 318 simulated PV plants in the state of California, and a spatio-temporal statistical 1-min-ahead forecast reconciliation over 17 irradiance sensors on the Oahu Island, Hawaii. It is shown that reconciliation benefits both the gird operators and PV system owners by bringing more accurate forecasts, and thus motivates information sharing in an electricity grid.},

  abstract  = {Hierarchical time series is a set of time series organized by aggregation constraints and it is widely used in many real-world applications. Usually, hierarchical time series forecasting can be realized with a two-step method, in which all time series are forecasted independently and then the forecasting results are reconciled to satisfy aggregation consistency. However, these two-step methods have a high computational complexity and are unable to ensure optimal forecasts for all time series. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical forecasting approach to solve the above problems. Based on multi-task learning, we construct an integrated model that combines features of the bottom level series and the hierarchical structure. Then forecasts of all time series are output simultaneously and they are aggregated consistently. The model has the advantage of utilizing the correlation between time series. And the forecasting results are overall optimal by optimizing a global loss function. In order to avoid the curse of dimensionality as the number of time series grows larger, we further learn a sparse model with group sparsity and element-wise sparsity constraints according to data characteristics. The experimental results on simulation data and tourism data demonstrate that our method has a better overall performance while simplifying forecasting process.},

  abstract  = {AbstractLarge collections of time series often have aggregation constraints due to product or geographical groupings. The forecasts for the most disaggregated series are usually required to add-up exactly to the forecasts of the aggregated series, a constraint we refer to as “coherence”. Forecast reconciliation is the process of adjusting forecasts to make them coherent. The reconciliation algorithm proposed by Hyndman et al. (2011) is based on a generalized least squares estimator that requires an estimate of the covariance matrix of the coherency errors (i.e., the errors that arise due to incoherence). We show that this matrix is impossible to estimate in practice due to identifiability conditions. We propose a new forecast reconciliation approach that incorporates the information from a full covariance matrix of forecast errors in obtaining a set of coherent forecasts. Our approach minimizes the mean squared error of the coherent forecasts across the entire collection of time series under the assumption of unbiasedness. The minimization problem has a closed form solution. We make this solution scalable by providing a computationally efficient representation. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method compared to alternative methods using a series of simulation designs which take into account various features of the collected time series. This is followed by an empirical application using Australian domestic tourism data. The results indicate that the proposed method works well with artificial and real data.},

  abstract  = {The sum of forecasts of disaggregated time series is often required to equal the forecast of the aggregate, giving a set of coherent forecasts. The least squares solution for finding coherent forecasts uses a reconciliation approach known as MinT, proposed by Wickramasuriya, Athanasopoulos, and Hyndman (2019). The MinT approach and its variants do not guarantee that the coherent forecasts are non-negative, even when all of the original forecasts are non-negative in nature. This has become a serious issue in applications that are inherently non-negative such as with sales data or tourism numbers. While overcoming this difficulty, we reconsider the least squares minimization problem with non-negativity constraints to ensure that the coherent forecasts are strictly non-negative. The constrained quadratic programming problem is solved using three algorithms. They are the block principal pivoting (BPV) algorithm, projected conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm, and scaled gradient projection algorithm. A Monte Carlo simulation is performed to evaluate the computational performances of these algorithms as the number of time series increases. The results demonstrate that the BPV algorithm clearly outperforms the rest, and PCG is the second best. The superior performance of the BPV algorithm can be partially attributed to the alternative representation of the weight matrix in the MinT approach. An empirical investigation is carried out to assess the impact of imposing non-negativity constraints on forecast reconciliation over the unconstrained method. It is observed that slight gains in forecast accuracy have occurred at the most disaggregated level. At the aggregated level, slight losses are also observed. Although the gains or losses are negligible, the procedure plays an important role in decision and policy implementation processes.},

  abstract = {Point forecast reconciliation of collection of time series with linear aggregation constraints has evolved substantially over the last decade. A few commonly used methods are GLS (generalized least squares), OLS (ordinary least squares), WLS (weighted least squares), and MinT (minimum trace). GLS and MinT have similar mathematical expressions, but they differ by the covariance matrix used. OLS and WLS can be considered as special cases of MinT where they differ by the assumptions made about the structure of the covariance matrix. All these methods ensure that the reconciled forecasts are unbiased, provided that the base forecasts are unbiased. The ERM (empirical risk minimizer) approach was proposed to relax the assumption of unbiasedness. This paper proves that (a) GLS and MinT reduce to the same solution; (b) on average, a method similar to ERM (which we refer to as MinT-U) can produce better forecasts than MinT (lowest total mean squared error) which is then followed by OLS and then by base; and (c) the mean squared error of each series in the structure for MinT-U is smaller than that for MinT which is then followed by that for either OLS or base forecasts. We show these theoretical results using a set of simulation studies. We also evaluate them using the Australian domestic tourism data set.},

An accurate demand forecast is required at several different levels of a supply chain network to support the planning and decision-making process in various departments. In this paper, we investigate the performance of bottom-up, top-down and optimal combination forecasting approaches in a supply chain. We first evaluate their forecast performance by means of a simulation study and an empirical investigation in a multi-echelon distribution network from a major European brewery company. For the latter, the grouped time series forecasting structure is designed to support managers' decisions in manufacturing, marketing, finance and logistics. Then, we examine the forecast accuracy of combining forecasts of these approaches. Results reveal that forecast combinations produce forecasts that are more accurate and less biased than individual approaches. Moreover, we develop a model to analyse the association between time series characteristics and the effectiveness of each approach. Results provide insights into the interaction among time series characteristics and the performance of these approaches at the bottom level of the hierarchy. Valuable insights are offered to practitioners and the paper closes with final remarks and agenda for further research in this area.},

  abstract  = {This paper investigates mortality inequality across U.S. states by modeling and forecasting mortality rates via a forecast reconciliation approach. Understanding the heterogeneity in state-level mortality experience is of fundamental importance, as it can assist decision making for policymakers, health authorities, as well as local communities who are seeking to reduce inequalities and disparities in life expectancy. A key challenge of multi-population mortality modeling is high dimensionality, and the resulting complex dependence structures across sub-populations. Moreover, when projecting future mortality rates, it is important to ensure that the state-level forecasts are coherent with the national-level forecasts. We address these issues by first obtaining independent state-level forecasts based on classical stochastic mortality models, and then incorporating the dependence structure in the forecast reconciliation process. Both traditional bottom-up reconciliation and the cutting-edge trace minimization reconciliation methods are considered. Based on the U.S. total mortality data for the period 1969–2017, we project the 10-year-ahead mortality rates at both national-level and state-level up to 2027. We find that the geographical inequality in the longevity levels is likely to continue in the future, and the mortality improvement rates will tend to slow down in the coming decades.},

For instance, commercial organizations often want to forecast inventories simultaneously at store, city, and state levels for resource planning purposes. In such applications, it is important that the forecasts, in addition to being reasonably accurate, are also consistent w.r.t one another. Although forecasting such hierarchical time series has been pursued by economists and data scientists, the current state-of-the-art models use strong assumptions, e.g., all forecasts being unbiased estimates, noise distribution being Gaussian. Besides, state-of-the-art models have not harnessed the power of modern nonlinear models, especially ones based on deep learning. In this paper, we propose using a flexible nonlinear model that optimizes quantile regression loss coupled with suitable regularization terms to maintain the consistency of forecasts across hierarchies. The theoretical framework introduced herein can be applied to any forecasting model with an underlying differentiable loss function. A proof of optimality of our proposed method is also provided. Simulation studies over a range of datasets highlight the efficacy of our approach.},

It can be challenging to estimate the full cross-covariance matrix for a temporal hierarchy, which can easily be of very large dimension, yet it is difficult to know a priori which part of the error structure is most important. To address these issues, we propose to use eigendecomposition for dimensionality reduction when reconciling forecasts to extract as much information as possible from the error structure given the data available. We evaluate the proposed estimator in a simulation study and demonstrate its usefulness through applications to short-term electricity load and financial volatility forecasting. We find that accuracy can be improved uniformly across all aggregation levels, as the estimator achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while being applicable to hierarchies of all sizes.},

However, when dealing with hierarchical time series, apart from selecting the most appropriate forecasting model, forecasters have also to select a suitable method for reconciling the base forecasts produced for each series to make sure they are coherent. Although some hierarchical forecasting methods like minimum trace are strongly supported both theoretically and empirically for reconciling the base forecasts, there are still circumstances under which they might not produce the most accurate results, being outperformed by other methods. In this paper we propose an approach for dynamically selecting the most appropriate hierarchical forecasting method and succeeding better forecasting accuracy along with coherence. The approach, to be called conditional hierarchical forecasting, is based on Machine Learning classification methods and uses time series features as leading indicators for performing the selection for each hierarchy examined considering a variety of alternatives. Our results suggest that conditional hierarchical forecasting leads to significantly more accurate forecasts than standard approaches, especially at lower hierarchical levels.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a data-driven approach applied to the long term prediction of daily time series in the Neural Forecasting Competition. The proposal comprises the use of adaptive fuzzy rule-based systems in a top-down modeling framework. Therefore, daily samples are aggregated to build weekly time series, and consequently, model optimization is performed in a top-down framework, thus reducing the forecast horizon from 56 to 8 steps ahead. Two different disaggregation procedures are evaluated: the historical and daily top-down approaches. Data pre-processing and input selection are carried out prior to the model adjustment. The prediction results are validated using multiple time series, as well as rolling origin evaluations with model re-calibration, and the results are compared with those obtained using daily models, allowing us to analyze the effectiveness of the top-down approach for longer forecast horizons. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Institute of Forecasters.},

  abstract  = {Times series often offers a natural disaggregation in a hierarchical structure. For example, product sales can come from different cities, districts, or states; or be grouped by categories and subcategories. This hierarchical structure can be useful for improving the forecast, and this strategy is known as hierarchical time series (HTS) analysis. In this work, a novel strategy for sales forecasting is proposed using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and hierarchical time series. We formalize three different hierarchical time series approaches: bottom-up SVR, top-down SVR, and middle-out SVR, and use them in a sales forecasting project for the Travel Retail Industry. Various hierarchical structures are proposed for the retail industry in order to achieve accurate product-level predictions. Experiments on these datasets demonstrate the virtues of SVR-based hierarchical time series in terms of predictive performance when compared with the traditional ARIMA and Holt-Winters approaches for this task.},

  abstract        = {In recent decades, there has been significant growth in the capital market for mortality- and longevity-linked bonds. Therefore, modeling and forecasting the mortality indexes underlying these bonds have crucial implications for risk management in life insurance companies. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical reconciliation approach to constructing probabilistic forecasts for mortality bond indexes. We apply this approach to analyzing the Swiss Re Kortis bond, which is the first longevity trend bond introduced in the market. We express the longevity divergence index associated with the bond's principal reduction factor (PRF) in a hierarchical setting. We first adopt time-series models to obtain forecasts on each hierarchical level, and then apply a minimum trace reconciliation approach to ensure coherence of forecasts across all levels. Based on the reconciled probabilistic forecasts of the longevity divergence index, we estimate the probability distribution of the PRF of the Kortis bond, and compare our results with those stated in Standard and Poor's report on pre-sale information. We also illustrate the strong performance of the approach by comparing the reconciled forecasts with unreconciled forecasts as well as those from the bottom-up approach and the optimal combination approach. Finally, we provide first insights on the interest spread of the Kortis bond throughout its risk period 2010-2016.},

  abstract      = {Age-specific mortality rates are often disaggregated by different attributes, such as sex, state, ethnic group and socioeconomic status. In making social policies and pricing annuity at national and subnational levels, it is important not only to forecast mortality accurately, but also to ensure that forecasts at the subnational level add up to the forecasts at the national level. This motivates recent developments in grouped functional time series methods (Shang and Hyndman, in press) to reconcile age-specific mortality forecasts. We extend these grouped functional time series forecasting methods to multivariate time series, and apply them to produce point forecasts of mortality rates at older ages, from which fixed-term annuities for different ages and maturities can be priced. Using the regional age-specific mortality rates in Japan obtained from the Japanese Mortality Database, we investigate the one-step-ahead to 15-step-ahead point-forecast accuracy between the independent and grouped forecasting methods. The grouped forecasting methods are shown not only to be useful for reconciling forecasts of age-specific mortality rates at national and subnational levels, but they are also shown to allow improved forecast accuracy. The improved forecast accuracy of mortality rates is of great interest to the insurance and pension industries for estimating annuity prices, in particular at the level of population subgroups, defined by key factors such as sex, region, and socioeconomic grouping.},

A temporal hierarchy can be constructed for any time series by means of non-overlapping temporal aggregation. Predictions constructed at all aggregation levels are combined with the proposed framework to result in temporally reconciled, accurate and robust forecasts. The implied combination mitigates modelling uncertainty, while the reconciled nature of the forecasts results in a unified prediction that supports aligned decisions at different planning horizons: from short-term operational up to long-term strategic planning. The proposed methodology is independent of forecasting models. It can embed high level managerial forecasts that incorporate complex and unstructured information with lower level statistical forecasts. Our results show that forecasting with temporal hierarchies increases accuracy over conventional forecasting, particularly under increased modelling uncertainty. We discuss organisational implications of the temporally reconciled forecasts using a case study of Accident & Emergency departments.},

We begin by introducing the forecasting problems that retailers face, from the strategic to the operational, as sales are aggregated over products to stores and to the company overall. Aggregated forecasting supports strategic decisions on location. Product-level forecasts usually relate to operational decisions at the store level. The factors that influence demand, and in particular promotional information, add considerable complexity, so that forecasters potentially face the dimensionality problem of too many variables and too little data. The paper goes on to evaluate evidence on comparative forecasting accuracy. Although causal models outperform simple benchmarks, adequate evidence on machine learning methods has not yet accumulated. Methods for forecasting new products are examined separately, with little evidence being found on the effectiveness of the various approaches. The paper concludes by describing company forecasting practices, offering conclusions as to both research gaps and barriers to improved practice.},

  abstract = {Demand forecasts are the basis of most decisions in supply chain management. The granularity of these decisions lead to different forecast requirements. For example, inventory replenishment decisions require forecasts at the individual SKU level over lead time, whereas forecasts at higher levels, over longer horizons, are required for supply chain strategic decisions. The most accurate forecasts are not always obtained from data at the 'natural' level of aggregation. In some cases, forecast accuracy may be improved by aggregating data or forecasts at lower levels, or disaggregating data or forecasts at higher levels, or by combining forecasts at multiple levels of aggregation. Temporal and cross-sectional aggregation approaches are well established in the literature. More recently, it has been argued that these two approaches do not make the fullest use of data available at the different hierarchical levels of the supply chain. Therefore, consideration of forecasting hierarchies (over time and other dimensions), and combinations of forecasts across hierarchical levels, have been recommended. This paper provides a comprehensive review of research dealing with aggregation and hierarchical forecasting in supply chains, based on a systematic search. The review enables the identification of major research gaps and the presentation of an agenda for further research.},

Extensive research focuses on improving the accuracy of each hierarchy, especially the intermittent time series at bottom levels. Then hierarchical reconciliation could be used to improve the overall performance further. In this paper, we present a \emph{hierarchical-forecasting-with-alignment} approach that treats the bottom level forecasts as mutable to ensure higher forecasting accuracy on the upper levels of the hierarchy. We employ a pure deep learning forecasting approach N-BEATS for continuous time series at the top levels and a widely used tree-based algorithm LightGBM for the intermittent time series at the bottom level. The \emph{hierarchical-forecasting-with-alignment} approach is a simple yet effective variant of the bottom-up method, accounting for biases that are difficult to observe at the bottom level. It allows suboptimal forecasts at the lower level to retain a higher overall performance. The approach in this empirical study was developed by the first author during the M5 Forecasting Accuracy competition, ranking second place. The method is also business orientated and could benefit for business strategic planning.},

These advances have not generally been replicated at the subnational level, likely because of the empirical challenges that nowcasting at a regional level presents, in particular the short time series of available data, changes in data frequency over time and the hierarchical structure of the data. This papers develops a mixedfrequency Bayesian VAR model to address common features of the regional nowcasting context, using an application to regional productivity in the UK. We evaluate the contribution that dierent features of our model provide to the accuracy of point and density nowcasts, in particular the role of hierarchical aggregation constraints. We show that these aggregation constraints play a key role in delivering improved regional nowcasts; they prove more important than adding region specic predictors when the equivalent national data are known, but not when this aggregate is unknown.},
