After the great success of the previous two energy forecasting competitions we have run ([GEFCom2012](http://www.drhongtao.com/gefcom/2012) and [GEFCom2014](http://www.drhongtao.com/gefcom/2014)), we are holding another one, this time focused on hierarchical probabilistic load forecasting. Check out all the details over on [Tao Hong's blog](http://blog.drhongtao.com/2016/10/gefcom2017-hierarchical-probabilistic-load-forecasting.html).

The previous GEFComs have led to some major advances in forecasting methodology, available via [IJF papers](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01692070/32/3) by the winning teams. I expect similar developments to arise out of this competition. Winners get to present their work in [Cairns, Australia at ISEA2017](https://forecasters.org/22nd-iif-workshop/).
