Rmarkdown templates for staff and students in my department are now available via the [monash package on github](https://github.com/numbats/monash).
This provides templates for

   - PhD thesis
   - Honours thesis
   - working papers
   - exams
   - letters
   - reports

For beamer slides with a Monash Business School theme, use the [`binb` package](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/binb).
