I gave a one-day LaTeX workshop today.

Here is the blurb:

>LaTeX is an extremely powerful markup language for creating structured documents. It is particularly well-suited for documents containing mathematics, but can be used for any document. Those whose publications involve a large number of mathematical equations often use LaTeX rather than MS-Word or some other word processing package. It is the standard writing tool for most research in the mathematical sciences. LaTeX provides a facility for pdf output so that it is easy to share your research with other people who don't have LaTeX installed. Remarkably, LaTeX is freeware

>This workshop will introduce LaTeX for Windows. No prior knowledge of LaTeX will be assumed.
