From today's email:

>I have just finished reading a copy of ['Forecasting:Principles and Practice'](http://www.otexts.org/fpp) and I have found the book really interesting. I have particularly enjoyed the case studies and focus on practical applications.
>
>After finishing the book I have joined a forecasting competition to put what I've learnt to the test. I do have a couple of queries about the forecasting outputs required. The output required is a quantile forecast, is this the same as prediction intervals? Is there any R function to produce quantiles from 0 to 99?

>If you were able to point me in the right direction regarding the above it would be greatly appreciated.

Presumably the competition is [GEFCOM2014](http://www.gefcom.org) which I've [posted about before](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/gefcom-2014/).

The future value of a time series is unknown, so you can think of it as a random variable, and its distribution is the "forecast distribution". A "quantile forecast" is a quantile of the forecast distribution. The usual point forecast is often the mean or the median of the forecast distribution. A prediction interval is a range of specified coverage probability under that distribution. For example, if we assume the forecast distribution is normal, then the 95% prediction interval is defined by the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the forecast distribution.

Still assuming normality, we could generate the forecast quantiles from 1% to 99% in R using

```r
    qnorm((1:99)/100, m, s)
```

where `mu` and `sigma` are the estimated mean and standard deviation of the forecast distribution. So if you are using the forecast package in R, you can do something like this:

```{r, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
    library(forecast)
    fit <- auto.arima(WWWusage)
    fc <- forecast(fit, h=20, level=95)
    qf <- matrix(0, nrow=99, ncol=20)
    m <- fc$mean
    s <- (fc$upper-fc$lower)/1.96/2
    for(h in 1:20)
      qf[,h] <- qnorm((1:99)/100, m[h], s[h])

    plot(fc)
    matlines(101:120, t(qf), col=rainbow(120), lty=1)
```

Of course, assuming a normal distribution is rather restrictive and not very interesting. For a more interesting but much more complicated approach to generating quantiles, see my 2010 paper on [Density forecasting for long-term peak electricity demand](/publications/peak-electricity-demand/).
