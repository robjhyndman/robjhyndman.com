Muhammad Akram was my PhD student a few years ago, and has remained a good friend since he moved on. Here is an [ interview he recently gave about moving to Australia](http://www.liveinvictoria.vic.gov.au/information/skilled-migrants/migrant-stories/muhammad-akrams-story?SQ_PAINT_LAYOUT_NAME=extended). Thanks, Akram, for the kind words about me!
