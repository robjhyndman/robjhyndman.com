Journal Clubs are a great way to learn new research ideas and to keep up with the literature. The idea is that a group of people get together every week or so to discuss a paper of joint interest. This can happen within your own research group or department, or virtually online.

There is now a virtual journal club operating in conjunction with [CrossValidated.com](http://CrossValidated.com). The [first paper discussed was on text data mining](http://meta.stats.stackexchange.com/q/674/159). It appears that the [next paper may be on collaborative filtering](http://meta.stats.stackexchange.com/q/685/159).

The emphasis is on Open Access papers, preferably with associated software that is freely available. Some of the discussion tends to centre on how to implement the ideas in [R](http://www.r-project.org).

For those of us in Australia, the timing is tricky. The first discussion took place at 3am local time!

If you can't make the [CrossValidated Journal Club](http://meta.stats.stackexchange.com/q/685/159) chats, why not start your own local club?
