It would be nice to have a place to share ideas, links, comments in a very informal way with others involved in research in statistical methodology and data science. [CrossValidated.com](http://crossvalidated.com) is great for specific questions, but is not suitable for commenting on papers or sharing ideas and links.<!-- more -->

Although I have a facebook account, this seems the wrong place to carry out a research discussion because my family and friends are generally not interested, and it is messy to restrict posts to groups of friends. (In general, I ignore friend requests from anyone other than family and people I interact with outside of work.) Also, the search facilities are non-existent, so if you want to find that post from a month ago, there is no alternative but to trawl through the history looking for it.

[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com) is a more natural fit, and there are groups set up just for this purpose. For example, there is an active [forecasting group](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=81950) and another for [R](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=77616). There is also a very active data analytics group called [AnalyticBridge](http://www.linkedin.com/groups/AnalyticBridge-58394).

Now we have [Google+](https://plus.google.com/) which aims to be all things to all people. Using circles of friends makes it easy to share posts with subsets of friends and so it could be a useful place for interacting with family, friends, work-colleagues, other researchers, and any other group, without flooding each of them with irrelevant posts.  It is early days but it has the potential to do everything [facebook](http://www.facebook.com) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com) already do and more. It still needs search (which is odd given it is a Google product), and groups, but I'm sure they aren't far away. So if you're game, [sign up](http://plus.google.com) and check it out. If you want to add me as a friend, do it via [my Google+ profile](https://plus.google.com/112705804904207349062/).
