For those who have not read the seminal works of Tufte and Cleveland, please hang your heads in shame. To salvage some sense of self-worth, you can then head over to [Solomon Messing's blog](https://solomonmg.github.io/) where he is starting [a series on data visualization](https://solomonmg.github.io/post/visualization-series-insight-from-cleveland-and-tufte-on-plotting-numeric-data-by-groups/) based on the principles developed by Tufte and Cleveland (with R examples).

The classics are also worth reading, and remain relevant despite the 20 or 30 years that have elapsed since they appeared.
