For all those people asking me how to obtain a print version of my book "Forecasting: principles and practice" with George Athanasopoulos, you now can.

[![FPP cover](/files/fppcover.jpg)](https://www.createspace.com/4486639)

**[Order on Amazon](http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=140570\&GR_URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2F0987507109)**


The online book will continue to be freely available. The print version of the book is intended to help fund the development of the [OTexts platform](http://www.otexts.org).

The price is US$45, £27 or €35.

Compare that to $195 for [my previous forecasting textbook](http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=140570\&GR_URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2F0471532339),  $150 for [Fildes and Ord](http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=140570\&GR_URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2F0324311273), or $182 for [Gonzalez-Rivera](http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=140570\&GR_URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2F0131474936). No matter how good the books are, the prices are absurdly high.

[OTexts](http://www.otexts.org) is intended to be a different kind of publisher --- all our books are online and free, those in print will be reasonably priced.

The online version will continue to be updated regularly. The print version is a snapshot of the online version today. We will release a new print edition occasionally, no more than annually and only when the online version has changed enough to warrant a new print edition.

We are planning an offline electronic version as well. I'll announce it here when it is ready.
