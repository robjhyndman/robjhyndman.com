RStudio has been a life-changer for the way I work, and for how I teach data analysis. I still have a couple of minor frustrations with it, but they are slowly disappearing as RStudio adds features.

I use dual monitors and I like to code on one monitor and have the console and plots on the other monitor. Otherwise I see too little context, and long lines get wrapped making the code harder to read. So I was very excited to see that RStudio has provided a great Christmas present this year, with source code panes able to be split off into separate windows.

You need the [preview version](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) as the feature hasn't yet found its way into the release version. The features are explained in this [help file](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/207126217-Using-Source-Windows), in which I also discovered the amazing shortcut `Ctrl + .` to jump to a function definition. I've no idea how long that has been in RStudio, but I'll be using it a lot.

Now if they would only introduce the ability to select columns for cut/copy/paste ...
