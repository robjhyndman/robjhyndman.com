The [M4 forecasting competition](https://www.m4.unic.ac.cy/) is well under-way, and a few of my PhD students have been working on submissions.

[Pablo Montero-Manso](https://github.com/pmontman), [Carla Netto](https://github.com/carlanetto), and [Thiyanga Talagala](https://acems.org.au/our-people/thiyanga-talagala) have made an R package containing all of the data (100,000 time series), which should make it substantially easier for other contestants to load the data into R in order to compute forecasts.

Grab the package from this [github repository](https://github.com/carlanetto/M4comp2018).

For more details about the M4 competition see [this post](/hyndsight/m4competition/) or go to the [M4 website](https://www.m4.unic.ac.cy/).
