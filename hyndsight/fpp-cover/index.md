We now have a cover for the print version of my [forecasting book with George Athanasopoulos](http://www.otexts.org/fpp/).

[![FPP cover](/files/fppcover.jpg)](http://www.otexts.org/fpp/)

It should be on Amazon in a couple of weeks. The book is also [freely available online](http://www.otexts.org/fpp/).

The cover was produced by [Scarlett Rugers](http://www.scarlettrugers.com/) who I can happily recommend to anyone wanting a book cover designed.
