### Standard error

David Gordon Goddard

An inference that’s very often made –<br>
‘a population tends to closely share<br>
some feature that a smaller group displayed’ –<br>
is why my students need to be aware<br>
of standard error. Yet, it’s hard to learn,<br>
and students’ drive to listen fades with each<br>
attempt of mine to strive for ways to earn<br>
attention till my message has its reach.<br>
<br>
The teaching cycle brings around today<br>
my yearly chance to make this topic clear.<br>
I’ll aid my students, shorten what I say,<br>
and they can later go and persevere ...<br>
... ask how it differs from the things it’s like,<br>
and why we need it, what we couldn’t do<br>
if it weren’t here. But can my students strike<br>
the hours in busy lives to see this through ...<br>
... to think and tell themselves of things they know ...<br>
related things ... then try to make the link<br>
with standard error, find their gaps and so<br>
seek remedy where knowledge meets its brink?<br>
<br>
It’s four months on. A student whom I taught<br>
then calls to see me and in measured way<br>
explains she liked the insight I had brought<br>
to ‘estimation’, then goes on to say:<br>
“My research gathered data from a group,<br>
defined a mob of which the group’s just part;<br>
a feature in the group at six per cent<br>
would be, I thought, like echoed in the mob.<br>
I viewed the group as sample of the mob;<br>
but samples vary some from whence they’re drawn.<br>
Your standard error helped me calculate<br>
how far from six my estimate might stray.”<br>
<br>
She smiles and says she’d thought I’d like to know<br>
that standard error served to underlie<br>
her thinking. Yes, I’m happy that is so –<br>
but more, she’d thought it worth enough to try.
