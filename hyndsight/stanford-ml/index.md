title: Learn Machine Learning at Stanford for free
categories:

Andrew Ng's [machine learning course at Stanford](http://ml-class.org/) is being offered free to anyone online in the (northern) fall of 2011. I've seen some of the notes from this course and it looks to be an excellent broad introduction to machine learning and data mining. For example, support vector machines, neural networks, kernels, clustering, dimension reduction, etc.<!-- more -->

Statisticians should know something about this area (just as computer scientists working in machine learning should know some statistical modelling), and this would be a great way to learn it.

You can already see most of a previous year's lectures on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=machine+learning+stanford+%22machine+learning%22&as=1&and_queries=machine+learning+stanford&exact_query=machine+learning&or_queries=&negative_queries=&geo_name=stanford+ca&geo_latlong=&search_duration=&search_hl=&search_category_type=specific&search_category=27&search_sort=&uploaded=).
