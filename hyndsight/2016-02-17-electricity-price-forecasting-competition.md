The [GEFCom competitions](http://gefcom.org) have been a great success in generating good research on forecasting methods for electricity demand, and in enabling a comprehensive comparative evaluation of various methods. But they have only considered price forecasting in a simplified setting. So I'm happy to see this challenge is being taken up as part of the [European Energy Market Conference](http://www.eem2016.com) for 2016, to be held from 6-9 June at the University of Porto in Portugal.<!-- more -->

The objective is to providing a dynamic and realistic gaming context, to involve the scientific, academic and industry community in order to address a real price forecast problem. The challenge will be to forecast the hourly spot price of the Iberian Electricity Market, MIBEL, on a daily rolling basis, for the 24 hours of the 5 days ahead. Over 14 days of competition, from 4th to 17th of April 2016, until 10.00 UTC, competitors must submit the forecast for the 5 days ahead. Historical hourly data will be provided for 2015. The winner will receive 1000 € and the 3 highest ranked forecasters will have free access to the EEM2016 Conference.

Further information about the competition can be obtained at the [EEM2016 website](http://www.eem2016.com/price-forecast-competition/), the [COMPLATT website](http://complatt.smartwatt.net/) and the competition [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Complatt-953726651390812/).

For an excellent summary of the relevant research to date, check out Rafał Weron's [IJF review paper on price forecasting](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207014001083). A shorter and simpler introduction is provided by Tao Hong in his article on [Energy Forecasting: Past, Present and Future](https://forecasters.org/pdfs/foresight/ForesightWinter2014_Hong_Energy_Forecasting.pdf).
