The 37th annual [**International Symposium on Forecasting**](http://forecasters.org/isf) will be held in Cairns, Australia, from 25-28 June 2017. We plan to hold some workshops on Sunday 25 June, before the main conference.<!-- more -->

We are currently calling for workshop proposals. Proposals can be for a half-day or full-day workshop. As usual, there will be a Practitioner Track at the conference which generally leads to excellent attendance at the workshops.
