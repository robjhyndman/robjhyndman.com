Dave Giles pointed out on [his blog yesterday](http://davegiles.blogspot.com.au/2014/02/econometrics-at-monash-university.html)Â that my department is currently ranked in the [top 10 in the world for econometrics](http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.ecm.html), according to IDEAS. We are also ranked [13th in the world](http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.for.html) in forecasting. Since IDEAS only covers the economics literature, the forecasting rank does not take account of our work in other areas such as demographic forecasting, and electricity demand forecasting.

These rankings are only a rough indication of quality, but it is nice to see the department being recognized.
