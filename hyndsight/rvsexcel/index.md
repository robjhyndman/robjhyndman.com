title: Why R is better than Excel for teaching statistics
categories:

- R

This was the topic of a recent conversation on the [Australian and New Zealand R mailing list](https://list.science.auckland.ac.nz/sympa/info/stat-rdownunder). Here is an edited list of some of the comments made.


  * R is free.

  * R is well-documented.

  * R runs (really well) on *nix as well as Windows and Mac OS.

  * R is open-source. Trust in the R software is evident by its support among distinguished statisticians. However, the R user need not rely on trust, as the source code for R is freely available for public scrutiny.

  * R has a much broader range of [statistical packages](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/) for doing specialist work.

  * R has an enthusiastic user base who can offer [helpful advice](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/r) for free.

  * R creates far better graphics than Excel.

  * R has certain data structures such as data frames that can make analysis more straightforward than in Excel

  * R is better for doing complex jobs

  * R is a better educational tool as it uses standard statistical vocabulary rather than home-baked terminology.

  * R is easier to learn, use, and script than Excel.

  * R allows students easily to work with scripts, thus allowing the work to be reproducible.

  * R is intended to lead students towards programming; Excel is designed to keep people away from programming and encourages them to rely on someone else doing their programming (and often their thinking) for them.

  * Excel is known to be inaccurate whereas R is thoroughly tested. For a critique of Excel, see [McCullough & Heiser (2008)](http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~bdm25/excel2007.pdf).

  * The statistical package available in Excel is very limited in capability and should only be used by experienced applied statisticians who can work out when its output should be ignored.

  * While R takes a while to learn, it provides a broad range of possible analyses and does not constrain users to a very limited set of methods (as is the case for Excel).
