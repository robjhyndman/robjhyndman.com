Last year we had [WOMBAT (Workshop Organized by the Monash Business Analytics Team)](/hyndsight/wombat2016/) at the zoo, and [MeDaScIn (Melbourne Data Science Initiative)](/hyndsight/medascin2016/) in the city.

This year we are combining forces to hold [WOMBAT MeDaScIn 2017](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Data-Science-Melbourne/events/235815094/).

There will be four days of tutorials (Monday 29 May to Thursday 1 June), and the main conference on Friday 2 June. We have an impressive range of local and international presenters including Yihui Xie (author of Rmarkdown, Knitr, Bookdown, Blogdown and more), Di Cook (data visualization guru), Stephanie Kovalchik (Data Scientist at Tennis Australia), Amy Shi-Nash (Head of Data Science at Commonwealth Bank of Australia), Graham Williams (Director of Data Science at Microsoft) and many more. I'll be doing a workshop on ["Time series in R, forecasting and visualisation"](https://robjhyndman.com/seminars/forecasting-medascin/) with [Earo Wang](http://earo.me/).
