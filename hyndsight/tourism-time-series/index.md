A few years ago, I wrote a paper with George Athanasopoulos and others about a [tourism forecasting competition](/publications/the-tourism-forecasting-competition/). We originally made the data available as an online supplement to the paper, but that has unfortunately since disappeared although the paper itself is [still available](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijforecast.2010.04.009).

So I am posting the data here in case anyone wants to use it for replicating our results, or for other research purposes. The data are split into monthly, quarterly and yearly data. There are 366 monthly series, 427 quarterly series and 518 yearly series. Each group of series is further split into training data and test data. Further information is provided in the paper.

If you use the data in a publication, please cite the [IJF paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijforecast.2010.04.009) as the source, along with a link to this blog post.
