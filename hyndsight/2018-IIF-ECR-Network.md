The [International Institute of Forecasters](http://forecasters.org) has established interest group sections, devoted to specialized domains of forecasting. One of the first such sections will be for early career researchers.

So if you are a PhD student, post-doc, or otherwise a relatively junior researcher working in forecasting, this is for you! The first events will be during the [ISF in Thessaloniki](http://isf.forecasters.org) in June 2019, including the following:

  * **ECR welcoming event**. A meet and greet event prior to the ISF welcome reception. Refreshments will be provided.
  * **Panel Session 1**: *Life after PhD in academia*. Panellists: Tanya Garcia (Texas A&M), Rob Hyndman (Monash), Nikolaos Kourentzes (Lancaster), Haiyan Song (Hong Kong Polytechnic).
  * **Panel Session 2**: *Life after PhD in industry*. Panellists: Diane Berry (Bain & Company), Carla Di Cairano-Gilfedder (British Telecom), Mike Gilliland (SAS), Stephan Kolassa (SAP).
  * **Drinks in Thessaloniki**: A fun evening event.
  * **Post-conference tour**: Join us for the Thursday post-conference tour, a day spent at Meteora.

At least I can attend Panel Session 1, even though I'm not eligible to attend the rest!
