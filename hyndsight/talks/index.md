There is a nice post on Matt Might's blog entitled ["10 tips on how to give an academic talk"](http://matt.might.net/articles/academic-presentation-tips/). Check it out.

He recommends the following two books by Joey Asher.

* [Even a Geek can speak](http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=140570\&GR_URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2F0978577604)
* [15 Minutes Including Q&A: A Plan to Save the World From Lousy Presentations](http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=140570\&GR_URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2F0978577620)
