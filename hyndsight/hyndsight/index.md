Originally, I wrote this blog for my own PhD students and I covered issues to do with research. I called it "Research tips" because that is what it was meant to be.

However, over time I've started covering other things of interest to me, and the readership has grown way beyond what I ever expected. So I decided it was time to acknowledge the change of focus with a change of name. Hyndsight is intended to cover my reflections on anything to do with statistics, forecasting, research, technology, or whatever else I'm thinking about at the time that is somehow related to my job as a Professor of Statistics.

All the old links should still work as I have set up a redirection from researchtips to hyndsight. But if you find something is broken, please [let me know](mailto:rob.hyndman@monash.edu).
