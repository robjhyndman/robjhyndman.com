For years I've been telling everyone who would listen that MS-Word may sometimes be useful for short notes or for making a "Back in 5 minutes" sign to stick on your door, but if you want to write a serious document like an academic paper, a book or a thesis, then you should use a serious tool such as LaTeX. For those who are not yet convinced, Ben Klemens has a nice article entitled ["Why Word is a terrible program"](https://web.archive.org/web/20170401165039/http://fluff.info/terrible/).  It's well worth reading.

Update: here's another useful article on [Why LaTeX is superior to Office](http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2007/07/16/why-latex-is-superior-to-office/)
