Rmarkdown templates for staff and students in my department are now available on github.

For a PhD thesis, fork the repository [MonashThesis](https://github.com/robjhyndman/MonashThesis).

For an Honours thesis, fork the repository [MonashHonoursThesis](https://github.com/robjhyndman/MonashHonoursThesis).

For beamer slides with a Monash Business School theme, use the [`binb` package](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/binb).

For other templates, install the R package [MonashEBSTemplates R package](https://github.com/robjhyndman/MonashEBSTemplates). This provides templates for

   - working papers
   - exams
   - letters
   - reports
