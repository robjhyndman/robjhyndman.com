Every two years, the *International Journal of Forecasting* awards a prize to the best paper on energy forecasting. The prize is generously funded by Professor [Tao Hong](http://www.drhongtao.com/). This year, we will award the prize to a paper published in the *IJF* during the period 2015-2016. The prize will be US$1000 plus an engraved plaque. The award committee is [Rob J Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com), [Pierre Pinson](http://pierrepinson.com/) and [James Mitchell](https://www.wbs.ac.uk/about/person/james-mitchell).

Nominations are invited from any reader of the IJF. Each person may nominate up to three papers, but you cannot nominate a paper that you have coauthored yourself. Papers coauthored by Tao Hong or one of the award committee are not eligible for the prize. All nominations are to be accompanied by a short statement (up to 200 words) from the nominator, explaining why the paper deserves an award.

You can see the relevant papers published in the period 2015-2016 on [Google Scholar](https://goo.gl/QGw2ou). Of course, a good paper does not always get noticed, so don’t let the citation count sway you too much in nominating what you consider to be the best IJF paper from this period.

Nominations should be [sent to me by email](mailto:ijf@forecasters.org) by **13 April 2018**.
