Employers often contact me asking how to find a good statistician, econometrician or forecaster for their organization. Students also ask me how to go about finding a job when they finish their degree. This post is for both groups, hopefully making it easier for them to pair up appropriately.

General online job sites such as [seek](http://seek.com.au) or [careerjet](https://www.careerjet.com.au) are ok, but job-seekers can find it hard to find the relevant openings because job titles are so varied. In the general area of statistics, a job can appear under the titles "statistician", "analyst", "data miner", "data manager", "financial engineer" and a few dozen other labels. Many employers don't place the job in the best category, often because they don't understand what skills are required to do the job. Nevertheless, if I was looking for a job, I would certainly set up some automated searches on these sites.

In statistics, there are well-established job websites that are the best places for both employers and potential employees to meet up.

  * Australia & New Zealand: [careers.statsoc.org.au](https://careers.statsoc.org.au). This is a fantastic service from the Statistical Society of Australia and includes a lot of jobs, especially those requiring higher degrees.
  * Melbourne Data Science Meetup has a [job board with local data science jobs](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Melbourne/messages/boards/forum/20509896).
  * United States: [ASA JobWeb](https://www.amstat.org/your-career/asa-jobweb). This is a similar service from the American Statistical Association for jobs in the USA.
  * United Kingdom: [RSS Jobs Board](https://rss.org.uk/jobs-careers/jobs-board/). The Royal Statistical Society offers a similar job board for the UK.
  * [Math jobs](http://math-jobs.com) covers jobs in the mathematical sciences.

I do not know what is provided in other countries, but check with your national statistical association.

There are also e-mail lists and web forums that are widely subscribed and often contain job postings.

  * Australia statistics jobs forum: [SSA Forum](https://www.statsoc.org.au/forum-job-vacancies)
  * Australia and New Zealand econometrics: [ANZEcmet](http://groups.google.com/group/anzecmet/about)
  * United Kingdom statistics: [Allstat](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=allstat)
  * United Kingdom econometrics: [Econometric-research](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=econometric-research) (for research jobs)
  * [Machine Learning News](https://groups.google.com/g/ml-news) includes posts about machine learning jobs.

If I've missed any good places to advertise jobs, please add them in the comments.
