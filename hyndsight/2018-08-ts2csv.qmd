```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, cache=TRUE)
options(digits=3)
```

Occasionally R might not be the tool you want to use (hard to believe, but apparently that happens). Then you may need to export some data from R via a csv file. When the data is stored as a `ts` object, the time index can easily get lost. So I wrote a little function to make this easier, using the `tsibble` package to do almost all of the work in looking after the time index. (Thanks to Earo in the comments for greatly simplifying my original code.)

```r
# Convert time series data to csv
ts2csv <- function(x) {
  fname <- paste0(deparse(substitute(x)), ".csv")
  readr::write_csv(tsibble::as_tsibble(x, gather = FALSE), fname)
}

library(fpp2)
ts2csv(auscafe)    # Univariate monthly data
ts2csv(visnights)  # Multivariate quarterly data
ts2csv(elecdemand) # Multivariate half-hourly data
```
