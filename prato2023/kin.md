## Abstract

We present a novel method capable of accurate and coherent probabilistic forecasts for large collections of time series. We call it the Deep Poisson Mixture Network (DPMN). DPMN relies on the combination of neural networks and a statistical model for the joint distribution of the hierarchical multivariate time series structure. By construction, DPMN guarantees hierarchical coherence and provides simple rules for aggregation and disaggregation of the forecast distributions.

Our mixture density approach can accurately model a wide range of joint probability distributions while efficiently modeling cross-series correlations. In addition, the density is modular and compatible as an output layer with state-of-the-art neural architectures. We optimize DPMN's density through the composite likelihood strategy, allowing us to apply it to large-scale datasets encompassing hundreds of thousands of series.
