This paper discusses the use of forecast reconciliation with stock price time series and the corresponding stock index. The individual stock price series may be grouped using known meta-data or other clustering methods. We propose a novel forecasting framework that combines forecast reconciliation and clustering, to lead to better forecasts of both the index and the individual stock price series. The proposed approach is applied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index and its component stocks. The results demonstrate empirically that reconciliation improves forecasts of the stock market index and its constituents.
