Planning for a future workforce requires forecasts of age structure changes to inform policy decisions, particularly related to universities and immigration. We modify the traditional demographic growth-balance equation to account for workforce-specific dynamics, replacing births with graduate entry, modelling exits through death and retirement, and including a remainder term that captures migration and career changes. Functional data models are used to model age-specific components, while ARIMA models are used for time series components. Simulation is employed to generate forecast distributions, capturing uncertainty from all components. The approach is illustrated using data on Australia's scientific workforce, allowing us to forecast the age distribution of various scientific disciplines for the next ten years. This analysis was central to an Australian Academy of Science initiative, supporting strategic workforce planning and policy development for Australia's scientific community.
