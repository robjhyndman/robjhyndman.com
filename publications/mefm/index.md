The model we developed for peak electricity demand forecasting in [Hyndman and Fan (2010)](/publications/peak-electricity-demand/) is now widely used in practice around Australia, and has undergone many improvements and developments. This document describes the current version of the model. It will be updated from time to time as the model continues to be modified and improved.
