Purpose: The purpose of this study was to produce normative data for Rosner's Test of Visual Analysis Skills (TVAS). Methods: 886 unselected children aged 5 to 10 years and in the first 4 years of school in Australia were tested to threshold on the TVAS. Percentiles, means and standard deviations for each age group were calculated. Results: We found a steady increase in scores with grade and age and a significant difference in scores between each of the ages and grades. This indicates the test accurately reflects increased sophistication in visual analysis skills. There was no significant difference between girls and boys. Conclusions: Normative data is presented in terms of percentiles on each age group. Interpretation of the scores is discussed.
