## Abstract

Univariate, multivariate, and hierarchical forecasts can all be improved using projections onto linear subspaces, regardless of what forecasting method is used. I will show some theoretical guarantees of this statement, and demonstrate using empirical applications how linear projections can lead to (sometimes dramatic) improvements in forecast accuracy.
