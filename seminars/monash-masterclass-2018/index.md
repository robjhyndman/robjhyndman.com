Smart electricity meters are providing very rich data in their third year of deployment in Victoria. We now have the potential to see how millions of households and businesses consume high-frequency electricity. But what does this type of data tell us? And how should we use it?

I will discuss how to:

  - visualise data from smart electricity meters;
  - identify common household consumption patterns and anomalies;
  - consider the methods for forecasting demand for household electricity;
  - use information from smart electricity meters to monitor changes in the power industry and anticipate consumption trends.
