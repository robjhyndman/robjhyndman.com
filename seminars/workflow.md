Talk given at [Research Bazaar Victoria](https://resbaz.github.io/resbazvic2024/), Clayton, Australia.


## Abstract

I will demonstrate the digital tools that underpin the efficiency and reproducibility of my research workflow. Utilizing GitHub as the platform for version control and collaboration, and R as a foundational tool, I leverage the `renv` package for managing project-specific R dependencies, and the `targets` package to avoid unnecessary computation. I employ `quarto` for generating multiple versions of my research papers for online repositories and journal submissions, ensuring seamless integration of code and text, without duplication. I'll illustrate the workflow using a recent paper I coauthored on ["Forecasting interrupted time series"](https://robjhyndman.com/publications/fits.html).
