I will discuss and demonstrate several digital tools that underpin the efficiency and reproducibility of a modern research workflow. The workflow will combine the renv package for managing project-specific R dependencies, the targets package to avoid unnecessary computation, and quarto for generating multiple versions of papers for online repositories and journal submissions, ensuring seamless integration of code and text, without duplication. I’ll illustrate the workflow using a recent paper I coauthored on “Forecasting interrupted time series".
