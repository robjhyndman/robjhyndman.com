## Talk given at [rstudio::conf](https://rstd.io/conf), San Francisco.

Over the last few years, Rmarkdown seems to have taken over my life, or at least my written communication. These days I use Rmarkdown to maintain my website, write my blog, write textbooks, write academic papers, prepare slides for talks, keep my CV up-to-date, help my students write theses, prepare university policy documents, write letters, prepare exams, write reports for clients, and more. I haven't quite got to the point of using it for shopping lists, but perhaps that's my next Rmarkdown template.

I will reflect on the journey in getting to this point, what I've lost and what I've gained. I will also speculate on what might be next in the Rmarkdownification of my life.
