I used to be a Christian, and for several years I wrote a blog at this address, exploring ideas of faith and belief. I eventually lost my faith, as explained in my book [*Unbelievable*](/unbelievable/). When I reorganized this website, there didn't seem much point spending time converting those old posts, so they are no longer here.

Some of the posts were reworked into my book, including the last one [announcing my deconversion](/unbelievable/ch2.html).
