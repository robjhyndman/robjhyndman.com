    "text": "Preface\nI was a Christadelphian1 for nearly 30 years, from age 16 until I resigned in July 2013 when I no longer thought that there was sufficient evidence to warrant belief in the Bible or Christianity. This book explains why I changed.\nMany of my Christadelphian friends have asked why I no longer believe, and I want to give them the answer they deserve. After many years of speaking at Christadelphian meetings in Australia and in several other countries, there are a lot of people who have heard me talk about my faith, and will have wondered what has happened. Even more people have read my books, including The Way of Life (Hyndman, 2002), in which I have given reasons to believe the Bible’s message. Some readers have written to me asking what I now think about these “reasons”. This book is my attempt to address these questions and to explain why I now think I was wrong.\nThis is a personal account. I am not attempting to write a comprehensive guide to the arguments against God and the Bible. There are already good books which do that. At the end, I list some that I found helpful and which are much more comprehensive than this memoir.\nI have divided my thoughts into three parts. Part A provides some background and reflects on the nature of faith and evidence, and whether faith should be affected by evidence. In Part B, I give a brief account of the things that made a difference to me, and a discussion of the arguments I have used in the past as reasons to believe in the Bible. Part C contains some of the hundreds of emails and letters I have received since I announced my unbelief, along with a few of my own reflections on them.\nEach chapter is illustrated with one of my photographs, mostly taken in the past two years. There is a connection between the photograph and chapter (in my mind at least), although it may not always be obvious.\nBefore I resigned as a member of the Christadelphian community, I had written a blog2 for a couple of years exploring some ideas about the Bible and how to interpret it appropriately. My purpose in writing the blog was to explore areas of faith, belief and tradition that I thought needed some re-examination. I had no agenda or predetermined endpoint; I simply wanted to think about the Bible, and Christian (especially Christadelphian) beliefs, and write about it. However, through my musings on faith, I eventually lost my faith. This book describes a little of that journey.\nI am grateful to a few friends who read an early draft of this book and provided helpful feedback and suggestions. In particular, Josh Barratt, Dave Hyndman, Naomi Hyndman, Nathan Islip, Jake Loveday, Sally Morgan and Trevor Nicholls all made suggestions that helped me clarify my thinking and writing. But most of all, I want to thank my wonderful wife, Leanne. She not only provided an honest critique of my book, she helped me through the most difficult time of my life with great courage, unfailing support and endless love. Thank you Leanne. You mean the world to me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristadelphians are a small, exclusive Christian denomination with about 60,000 members worldwide. They are distinctive for having no paid clergy, for their enthusiasm for Bible reading and study, and for their rejection of several mainstream Christian doctrines.↩︎\nSome material from my blog entries has been reworked into chapters for this book.↩︎"

They were the reasons I fell back on when the doubts crowded in (as they often did), and they were the reasons I gave others as evidence for why they should also believe. They are easy to remember as the first letters spell the word PREACH.\nOver time, each of those “reasons” had become less and less helpful as I had come to realise that they were not the strong evidence I once thought they provided. By the time I wrote to Josh, I had already given up on using the Environment, Archaeology, Consistency and Health Laws as reasons to believe. There were simply too many holes, contradictions and logical flaws to use them as evidence. At this stage I was still holding on to the first two reasons, Prophecy and Resurrection, but even there I was having doubts. I tried to construct an email using these reasons, but I kept deleting what I had written knowing that I was writing to convince myself rather than Josh."

    "text": "A reluctant unbeliever\nThe more I wrote, the more I deleted, trying to find words that seemed assured and logical, but failing. All the words I came up with seemed so inadequate. Why did I still believe in the Bible? Did I have any good reasons left? The more I thought about it, the more my faith dissipated.\nHere are a few paragraphs from what I finally managed to write to him.\n\nI think we’ve wandered down many of the same thought roads, although we have ended up at different places (for now). Perhaps it would help if I explain something about my journey over the last couple of years.\n\n\nI came to the view that evolution was probably correct more than five years ago. That didn’t bother me much, as I accepted the view that Genesis 1 was simply a creation drama, presenting God as creator, and was not meant to be taken literally.\n\n\nIn the last couple of years I’ve become much more conscious of how weird our community is, and how many established practices have no biblical basis. That led me to start thinking about what was biblical, and what would a biblical church look like. In the process, I started to think about inspiration, because it wasn’t clear that there was a biblical mandate for a church at all.\n\n\nThat led me to thinking seriously about inspiration in other areas. At first, very tentatively because I was frankly scared about where it would lead. I looked at textual criticism, contradictions that could not easily be reconciled (although I’m rather expert at resolving such things!), cultural practices that we now consider highly objectionable (e.g., the rape laws, genocide, restrictions on women, etc.), mis-use of scripture by Matthew and others, etc.\n\n\nI’ve worked very slowly through all this, but have fairly recently come to the view that the Bible is a very human book, both in content, authorship, canon, and subsequent evolution. Now I’m not sure what to do with it.\n\n\nYou ask why I haven’t sliced God out of the picture. Perhaps I’m not there yet. I don’t know.\n\n\nSo where am I now? Mostly confused. I’ve thrown out a lot of theological and cultural baggage and I’m looking at what’s left and wondering if it can be put together in any kind of coherent manner that still involves God and the Bible. I really don’t know the answer to that.\n\nHaving sent the email, I kept going over and over in my mind whether I had any good reasons to believe. I lay awake at night wondering about it, praying about it. I read over what I had previously written on reasons to believe. I read what other people had written on it and the reasons they gave to believe. Nothing was convincing. The gaping holes appeared larger than they ever had before.\nWithin a week, I realised with a shock that I no longer had a reason to believe. I was a very reluctant unbeliever."

    "section": "What now?",
    "text": "What now?\nMy first response was to cancel all speaking and other responsibilities at my own ecclesia1, to give me time to think. Did I really want to give up on religion altogether, something I had been involved with for my whole life? Perhaps this was just a phase that would pass. Maybe I should just take a back seat for a while and see what happened.\nIt would have been easier if I had not been so involved, but I was speaking regularly at church events, often more than once per week. I was travelling to other parts of Australia, and occasionally overseas to speak at church conferences. I had written several books that were widely used within the Christadelphian community. To suddenly take a back seat without explanation was not so easy.\nAlso, I still had three major interstate events that I had agreed to speak at, and I felt obliged to do them. After the second of them, I could not go on. I felt such a fraud and the hypocrisy was eating me up. Those who knew me well could see that something was seriously wrong.\nEach night I would go to bed and just lie there, wide awake, and feeling so alone. Alone because I could no longer talk to the god I once believed in, and alone because I no longer felt part of the faith community that I still belonged to and around which my life had been centred. Although I was no longer speaking and teaching at church events, I kept up the pretence of attending on Sundays, not ready to give it all away, but not prepared to admit to my friends and family that I no longer believed.\nEventually my wife and I agreed that it would be better if I “came out” of the closet and told everyone. But I was worried about the effect on my family — most of whom were active participants in the Christadelphian community. So first I told my children where I was at, amidst many tears from all of us, and gave them plenty of time to adjust. After a month or two, they said they were tired of keeping my “secret” and wanted me to go public. I then travelled to see my parents and my wife’s parents, told a few close friends, gave them all a week or two to get used to the idea and ask any questions they wanted to, and finally resigned.\nThirty years of faith had come to an end."

    "text": "This is the blog post in which I announced my loss of faith and my resignation from the Christadelphian community — 29 July 2013\nThis week I resigned from the Christadelphian faith after nearly 30 years as a member, and having attended Christadelphian activities almost every week of my life.\nI resigned because I no longer believe. I don’t believe the Bible is inspired by God. I am not even sure there is a God. Perhaps there is, but he is not who I once thought he was. I was an active and enthusiastic believer from the time of my baptism at age 16, right up until a few months ago when my world of faith fell apart.\nI should have seen it coming, but I didn’t. I had embarked on what I thought was a quest to re-examine my beliefs, and encourage reform within the Christadelphian community. About two and a half years ago, I started this blog in which I publicly discussed some areas of Christadelphian beliefs (my beliefs) that I thought needed a re-think. I looked at our stance on voting in governmental elections and found it weak. I looked at our position on creation and evolution, and was persuaded by the arguments for evolution. I then tried to re-interpret Genesis (and some New Testament passages) in the light of this knowledge. I explored inspiration, and what it means, and how it might have worked. In particular, I wondered about the obvious errors in the Bible, the contradictions, the mythology borrowed from contemporary accounts, and I tried to construct an approach to inspiration that took all this into account while retaining divinely guided scriptures. I felt like I was part of a group forging a new and more enlightened way for Christadelphians.\nBut then, quite suddenly, I could not think of a good reason to believe any more. Far from inspired, the Bible now appeared as a collection of ancient human documents, full of propaganda, legend, and bigotry. Yes, there was some wisdom there, and some beautiful poetry, some uplifting words. But the attitudes to women and foreigners that it describes, sometimes commands, were not worthy of the God I once believed in. The alleged miracles seemed more like the superstitions of a primitive people than evidence for enlightened belief. Even the prophecies that I once found so convincing, appeared to be either contrived, out-of-context, or written after the alleged fulfilment. What I once thought were answers to prayer now appeared to be coincidence or imagined. My faith was always based on what I thought was evidence, and once the evidence was removed, the faith quickly followed.\nThe last few years have been difficult for me and my family, especially the last few months. It makes me sad to think that my actions have hurt the people I love the most. I feel like I’m letting a lot of people down, but I cannot pretend to believe when I don’t. I have always tried to be completely authentic in everything I do, and this is no different.\nI will miss the extraordinary community that I’ve benefited so much from. There is something wonderful about traveling to foreign countries and finding strangers ready to invite you into their homes, share their food and belongings, even lend you their car. I will miss the camps too; those weeks apart from everything else in life, having fun, enjoying music, exploring ideas, with delightful people who hold a shared perspective on the purpose of life. A perspective I no longer hold.\nAlmost all of my family and friends are Christadelphians. Almost all of my social activities have been with Christadelphians. I have spent a couple of weeks every year attending, and often speaking at, Christadelphian camps and Bible schools. While I would like to think that my friends will remain my friends, the reality is that Christadelphians spend an enormous amount of time together, making it difficult to retain friendships with “outsiders”. Nevertheless, I would like to somehow continue the friendships forged over many years of shared experiences.\nI expect some people to say things about me that are not true. That is a natural reaction, as my loss of faith will create doubts in others, and demonization of me will help people feel more sure. However, please do not impute motives that I don’t have.\nSo what should I call myself now I am not a Christadelphian, or even a Christian? I don’t like the term atheist, because it carries a sense of militancy and certainty that I don’t feel. I don’t like agnostic, because it implies (in Australia at least) a lack of interest in the questions of religion. I think I prefer “unbeliever”.\nEventually I would like to write a little about my new perspective on things I once believed. I would like to explain to people who have read my books why I now think I was wrong. But that can wait until later. I will keep this blog here, as I can see no good reason to hide what I’ve written — this is a record of what I thought at that time in my life.\nI’d particularly like to thank the Ringwood Christadelphian ecclesia for doing all they could to make us feel at home for the last 12 months. I am grateful for the love and warmth and friendship I have been shown."

    "text": "The beautiful movie Life of Pi is a story about a boy (Pi) raised in India where his father owns a small zoo. He is deeply religious and simultaneously embraces Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. At one level, the book is about Pi’s deep faith in the face of his father’s atheist disapproval. When the family and zoo emigrate for Canada, the ship founders in a storm, and Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with a hyena, a chimpanzee, a zebra and a Bengal tiger for company. It is a story of survival, grief, power and ambiguity. Each strange encounter adds further mystery to the enchanting tale. When Pi is finally rescued, the investigators want to know how the shipwreck occurred, and how Pi had survived at sea on a lifeboat with a tiger. They refuse to believe his extraordinary tale, so he provides an alternative and much more believable explanation involving murder and cannibalism. The first story then appears to be an allegory with the animals being metaphors for characters in the second story. Pi asks “Which is the better story?”. The narrator replies “the one with the animals”, and Pi concludes “And so it goes with God”.\nThe movie implies that religion provides a meta-narrative for life, a way of making sense of what happens to us. We can look at life from different perspectives, and we can choose what we want to believe. We believe what we do because we want to. Belief in God arises not because it is based on stronger evidential foundations, but for other reasons — it helps us deal with life’s struggles, it provides certainty and comfort, it is the better story.\nI saw the movie around the same time as my own view of religion was shifting, and so it resonated strongly. Was there any evidence to support my religious faith, or did I just believe it because I wanted to believe it? Did I want to believe the ancient and simplistic Jewish story of creation, or the more complex but more interesting story involving the random meanderings of mutations and survival? Did I want to believe that I would live forever because the son of God was crucified by some Roman soldiers in Jerusalem 2000 years ago, or should I accept the empirical evidence that I would live and die like every other human being?"

    "section": "Faith is the gap between evidence and truth",
    "text": "Faith is the gap between evidence and truth\nMany people have told me that I am mistaken in focusing on evidence, and that I just need to have faith. This is misguided. Why should religious belief be exempt from requiring evidence? My Christadelphian friends get very excited when they think there is evidence for their beliefs — they liked my lectures on archaeology and prophecy, for example. So when I claim that the evidence is insufficient for belief in the Bible, it is hypocritical to then decide that evidence is irrelevant.\nFaith is the gap between evidence and truth. The Bible agrees with this:\n\nNow faith is being sure of what we hope for, being convinced of what we do not see. (Hebrews 11:1)\n\nWhen there is a lot of evidence, we do not need much faith. No-one asks me to have faith in the periodic table, for example. But we are justifiably suspicious of people who have faith in crystals, as there is no evidence for crystal powers.\nReligious beliefs need to be subject to the same standards of evidence as any other beliefs. With the exception of mathematics, we do not have proof of anything we believe, but we do have good evidence. For example, there is strong evidence for the Jewish holocaust, and for the existence of electrons. While neither can be proven, the evidence is strong enough that almost no-one doubts them. But when astrology or homoeopathy are subjected to the evidence test, they fail. Why should we not treat the Bible in the same way?\nWe sometimes choose to believe something because it makes us feel better to do so, or because the alternatives are too scary to contemplate, or simply because we have never considered any other perspective. Nevertheless, I still think it is better to understand why we believe what we do. It may be satisfying and comforting to maintain a religious faith. It may provide the better story. But I prefer to believe things that are supported by evidence.\nNo doubt I am influenced by my education and profession. I am a Professor of Statistics at Monash University, Australia. Therefore I spend my professional life thinking about evidence and uncertainty. I analyse and interpret data, seeking to uncover the hidden truths in a morass of observations. I develop methods that use empirical evidence to test hypotheses. I use data to overturn or confirm what is believed or conjectured, and to help construct mathematical models that are more accurate approximations of reality. In a sense, I have applied a similar approach to my faith journey, and I have rejected the God hypothesis because I do not think the evidence supports it.\nUnlike other areas of mathematics, statistics involves inductive rather than deductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning is a form of logical argument that leads to definite conclusions. For example, “All men are mortal. Rob is a man. Therefore, Rob is mortal.” There is nothing uncertain about the argument. On the other hand, inductive reasoning is a form of logic based on probabilities and it leads to conclusions that are highly likely but not certain. For example,1 “More than 95% of baldness in men is due to male pattern baldness. Rob is bald. Therefore, it is highly likely that Rob has the genes for male pattern baldness.” Inductive arguments lead to the most probable explanation for the observed data — the stronger the argument, the higher the probability associated with the conclusion.\nThis is precisely the type of reasoning that is necessary when considering the evidence for God and the Bible. We cannot deduce that God exists by following a series of logical statements.2 But we can consider the inductive argument — is what we observe best explained by a supernatural God, or is there a more probable explanation?"

    "text": "Making a virtue of faith\nReligions make a virtue of faith, as if it is something to be valued. That is, people who believe without evidence (or even in spite of the evidence) are somehow more righteous than those who require evidence. The apostle Thomas was chastised by Jesus for requiring evidence:\n\n25 [Thomas] replied “Unless I see the wounds from the nails in his hands, and put my finger into the wounds from the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe it!” 26 Eight days later … Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!” 27 Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here, and examine my hands. Extend your hand and put it into my side. Do not continue in your unbelief, but believe.” 28 Thomas replied to him, “My Lord and my God!” 29 Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are the people who have not seen and yet have believed.” (John 20:25–29)\n\nWhy would God prefer people who believed without evidence? That seems to be a strange virtue.\nWe treat such people as gullible suckers in other areas of life. For example, people who take their horoscopes seriously are often derided for accepting what is obviously nonsense to the rest of us. We reject horoscopes as having any validity because there is no evidence that they provide any meaningful predictions beyond vague generalities. Yet why should we reject horoscopes on the basis of evidence (or lack thereof), while treating faith without evidence as a virtue in a religious context?\nI can see no virtue in faith. Quite the opposite — it is much more virtuous to be skeptical unless there is sufficient evidence to warrant belief. Blessed are the people who have rejected superstitions and who have only believed when there is supporting evidence."

I can be faithful to my wife, without needing to have faith that she exists. Being faithful is clearly a desirable quality in any relationship. I am not disputing the value of faithfulness. I am arguing that faith, in the sense of believing when there is limited evidence, should not be considered virtuous in any area of life, including religion.\nNot only is faith of no value, it can be dangerous. It is faith that leads fundamentalist Muslims to blow themselves up in a crowded marketplace, believing that they will be welcomed into heaven by 70 young virgins. It is faith that leads some Christians to abuse gay men and women, pushing many into depression and suicide, believing they are standing up for God’s moral standards.\nThe philosopher and neuroscientist, Sam Harris, has written:3 >“We have names for people who have many beliefs for which there is no rational justification. When their beliefs are extremely common, we call them ‘religious’; otherwise, they are likely to be called ‘mad,’ ‘psychotic’ or ‘delusional.’”"

We seek the opinion of experts when we buy a house, trusting they are correct. We place our lives in the hands of airlines when we fly, having faith that the pilot is not a terrorist. We enter into a business partnership trusting that everyone involved is participating in “good faith”. In every case, we do whatever background checks seem appropriate: Are the experts providing a report on the foundations of the house reputable? Does the airline have a good safety record? Do we know the people involved in the business partnership well enough?\nI am arguing that we should do the same background checks on religion before mortgaging the life we have.

We tend to give greater weight to information supporting our existing beliefs, and we tend to either ignore or dismiss information that is inconsistent with our existing beliefs. We see what we are looking for, we persist with discredited beliefs, and we are very reluctant to overturn any conclusions we have drawn, no matter how flimsy the evidence supporting them.12 The more attached we are to those beliefs, the harder it is to assess them objectively.

In 1944, he was sent to the island of Lubang off the coast of the Philippines in order to hamper enemy attacks on the island. Under no circumstances was he to surrender or take his own life. Unfortunately, nobody told him when the war ended.\nEating rice, coconuts and meat from stolen cattle, Hiroo Onoda hid in the jungle for 29 years, carrying out occasional guerrilla activities and waiting for further instructions.\nHe avoided search parties sent to find him, believing they were enemy scouts. Leaflets announcing the end of the war were assumed to be propaganda. Newspapers, letters and family pictures dropped from the air were taken to be a trick. Friends and relatives even spoke out over loudspeakers, but Onoda remained suspicious, and did not believe that the war had really ended.\nLater he wrote 3\n\n“We considered people dressed as islanders to be enemy troops in disguise or enemy spies. The proof that they were was that whenever we fired on one of them, a search party arrived shortly afterward.”\n\nEverything was interpreted within the context of what he already believed.\nEventually, his former commanding officer was located, working as a bookseller in southern Japan. He flew to Lubang Island to officially relieve Onoda of duty. On 9 March 1974, Onoda finally surrendered, turning over his sword, rifle, dagger and ammunition.\nHe discovered a very different world from the one he believed existed."

For 30 years I believed that the Bible was inspired by God, that God heard my prayers, that Jesus was going to return to the earth, that dead people would be raised to life at his return, that Jesus would set up his kingdom with the capital in Jerusalem, and so on. I interpreted all the evidence within the context of what I already believed.\nAny evidence that appeared to go against what I believed was dismissed as either: (a) something that could be explained if only we had more information; or (b) a biased presentation by someone determined not to believe. In this way, I could happily continue with my beliefs regardless of any evidence that might appear to contradict them.\nThe problem is that beliefs that cannot be contradicted are no different from delusions. Any belief worth acting on must be falsifiable. That is, it must be possible to reject the belief as false if there is sufficient evidence against it.\nFalsifiability is an important concept in science. Scientific progress occurs when a theory or hypothesis is falsified through new evidence. Then a new theory or hypothesis is postulated that is consistent with all the available evidence including the new observations.\nIf a theory or belief cannot be falsified, there is no point in even examining the evidence for it. This is true in science and in religion.\nSome believers take pride in the fact that their faith cannot be shaken. When asked “What would convince you that your belief was mistaken?” they reply: “Nothing. That’s what it means to have faith.” There is no virtue in such dogmatic delusions. They might as well have steadfast faith in the tooth fairy."

It is reasonable to be skeptical about all supernatural beliefs unless there is sufficient evidence to support them. In other words, before any evidence is explored, the balance of probabilities must be on the side of unbelief rather than belief. Otherwise, we would need to take seriously all supernatural claims including voodoo dolls, fairies and Jesus appearing in slices of pizza.\nFor unbelievers, this is easier — their confirmation bias means that they are already skeptical. (However, there is still a danger of dogmatic and arrogant skepticism which must also be avoided if we are to treat the evidence reasonably.) For believers, it is extraordinarily difficult to put aside their natural confirmation bias, and try to take a skeptical perspective on what they believe.\nI was finally convinced that my religious beliefs were wrong once I was prepared to seriously consider the evidence. I thought about what would convince me that I was wrong, and I discovered that the evidence stacked up against what I had long held to be true. But it took a major shift in the way I viewed the evidence to come to this position. I had to be prepared to allow my beliefs to be falsifiable. I had to be prepared to seriously consider the evidence, and not just explain it away.\nOnoda was finally convinced that the war was over because the one piece of evidence he was prepared to accept was produced — his commanding officer told him that the war was over.\nWhatever your beliefs, it is well worth asking “What piece of evidence would convince you to change your mind?”."

I had trouble with this one, as it always seemed a little silly for me to be telling God why he was so great. I don’t think I would like people making lists of my good attributes, and I could never see why God would like it either. Often I would write down thoughts on the amazing world he had created, or how he was incredibly merciful to sinners like me. Sometimes I would just read a Psalm that I thought captured the ideas well — Psalm 103 and Psalm 145 were two of my favourites.\nNext I would write thoughts under C for Confession. I would try to list the things I could remember doing wrong since the previous morning. Most days I couldn’t think of anything at all, but I always assumed that was because I was fooling myself, and trying to cover up my inherent evil tendencies. Didn’t everyone sin every day?\nT for thanks came next. That was easy. There were always things I felt thankful for — my wonderful wife and children, my extended family, the ecclesia I attended, my friends, the great job I had, and so on. I would select a couple of these and thank God for them, presuming he had something to do with it. I would also thank God for apparent answers to prayer requests from previous days.\nFinally I came to S for Supplication or requests. That was the easiest of all. I could quickly come up with a shopping list of things I would like God to do. Because that seemed wrong, I would restrict my requests to four or five things that seemed most important. I often asked for help in upcoming talks I was giving at Bible schools and Bible study weekends. I would also asked for God’s blessing on people being baptised, or people who I knew were struggling with life in some way. Our personal finances were also a frequent subject, especially in the early stages of my career when I was on relatively low wages and supporting my wife and four hungry children."

It seemed to me that having a personal relationship with God was important. The faithful people in the Bible all had conversations with God, sometimes audibly and sometimes through prayers or prophets. Think about Abraham, Jacob, Moses, David, Hezekiah, Daniel, Jeremiah, Jesus and Paul, just to mention a few. God was involved in their lives, guiding them, communicating with them, supporting them through good times and bad. I wanted to be faithful and righteous, and so I thought it was important that God and I should be friends in some way. Besides, the religious books I read and the talks I listened to often emphasised the importance of “having a personal relationship” with God, although exactly what that meant or how to go about it was never discussed.\nHowever, it was clear to me that an important part of the relationship must be prayer. After all, if you were going to have a relationship with someone, you had to talk to them. That was what drove me to have a prayer time every morning, and it is why I repeatedly asked God to help me develop a closer relationship with him."

Apparently God wasn’t interested in doing that, or perhaps I was never able to hear him. Looking back, I now realise that this was one of the first things that made me think that the religion was bunkum, although it took me many years to admit that. I was devout and faithful, yet God never talked to me. What kind of relationship is that? If my wife never talked to me for years, and her side of the relationship was a bundle of old letters she wrote before we met, I wouldn’t have stuck with her either. Relationship needs interaction and communication, or it is a delusion.\nI have heard of fans of movie stars who imagine they have a relationship with their idol. They write them letters regularly, even talk to them audibly, and they imagine that the relationship is reciprocated. Psychologists refer to these types of relationships as “para-social” where the relationship is based on an illusion of interaction rather than any genuine social interaction. That is the kind of relationship that I had with God, and I suspect that other Christians are no different.\nJoan of Arc claimed to have a personal relationship with the Virgin Mary, Michael the Archangel, Saint Margaret and Saint Catherine. They all apparently spoke to her frequently with detailed instructions on how France should fight the war against England.\nWe normally doubt the sanity of anyone claiming they have a personal relationship with dead people. Yet a relationship with an invisible god is treated as reasonable, despite no-one ever producing any evidence of it. Are they all pretending? Are they insane? Or is it me who is insane?\nI so much wanted to have a relationship with God that I continued praying for years, and consequently I felt like I had a relationship with God. After all, I talked to him every day about everything that mattered to me. And when things turned out well, I could thank him for answering my prayers.

This is a valuable exercise if it leads to greater self-awareness and thoughtful improvements in our conduct.\nWhen I was being thankful for what I thought God had provided, I was consciously bringing to mind the good things in my life and feeling appreciative for them. Again, this is a useful exercise as it helps put problems in perspective. Without it, problems can feel overwhelming even when they are merely minor irritants. Deliberately concentrating on what we are grateful for can lead to improvements in well-being.23\nWhen I was making requests of God, I was making plans for the future. I was considering upcoming events and activities, I was considering how to deal with issues that were likely to arise, and I was wondering about my friends and their struggles. If this leads to better future planning, and greater awareness of the needs of others, then it is a worthwhile activity, regardless of whether any supernatural power is actually listening.\nIn other contexts this is called “reflection” or “meditation”, and it is practised in many religions and philosophies, whether or not they involve a God. Periods of self-reflection and meditation, and taking time to appreciate what you have, leads to greater peace and happiness.

If someone prays that X occurs and it does, then they say that the prayer has been answered. If X does not occur, then they say the answer was no, it wasn’t God’s will. In this way, every prayer is answered, regardless of what actually happens. In other words, answered prayers cannot provide evidence for God when the existence of God is already assumed.\nEven when prayers do not receive a positive answer, people search for reasons why that might have been the case. I remember praying for a young sister1 who had been seriously hurt in a car accident to be healed. It did not occur, and she died the following day. In discussions afterwards, comments were made such as “It must be for the best. God knows what he is doing. Perhaps she would have had a life of great suffering otherwise.” As if God couldn’t relieve her supposed future suffering in some way other than by killing her! In this way, every unanswered prayer becomes an answered prayer, as God’s motives are imagined, and comfort is taken in the assumed purpose.\nThe only real evidence that would support faith through answered prayer is when an answer (or a series of answers) is so improbable that it would be very unlikely to have occurred without some supernatural intervention. However, unlikely events occur given enough time. So in a person’s lifetime, if they have prayed for many specific things, then most likely they will have received answers that have a small probability of occurring by chance. These are the ones they remember, and recount. It seems amazing that the prayer was answered in such a manner, until you take account of all the prayers that did not receive such a remarkable “answer”."

She told us the story of when she had prayed for snow and on the next day there was so much snow that she could not go to school. My children were very impressed, and that night one of them prayed that it would snow “but just a little bit”. The next day it snowed for about an hour, just enough to cover the ground. After much excitement, one of the other children than prayed for “a foot of snow”. Six days later, we awoke to a blanket of snow. I don’t know whether it was one foot, or 6 inches, or 3 inches. We didn’t measure it. But we told everyone that there was a foot of snow, and we believed it because that is what had been prayed for. In this way, the prayer was “answered”. We lived in Colorado and it was October, the start of the snow season. After each prayer, it was certain to snow at some point in the following few days. The only potentially unlikely aspect of this was the amount of snow after each prayer. However, it was not really unusual to get a light sprinkling of snow followed by a heavier blanket of snow. Although it impressed my children (and me at the time), thinking about it now it seems that we imagined it to be more remarkable than it really was."

But that is like recording every time you roll a double six in a board game. Looking back on the list of double sixes makes it seem like you are a very lucky player, because you have left out all the other rolls. Similarly, keeping a list of remarkable answered prayers makes it seem that God is active in your life, because you leave out all the other non-answers.\nI can recite anecdotes of “answered” prayers as well as any believer, and I’ve used these stories in talks I’ve given. But looking back, they are just anecdotes, not evidence.\nThe trouble with discussing anecdotes of answered prayers is that it is impossible to properly quantify the probability of the events concerned. If they are to provide genuine evidence for God, then you need to record every answer or non-answer to prayer, and assess the probability of each event occurring. Not only is that impossible, it assumes that prayers are much more specific than they often are. People pray that God will “watch over them” over the coming week, and then if good things happen they can be attributed to God’s providence, and if bad things happen the prayer is either forgotten or it is assumed that God’s will is being done regardless."

This has the advantage of being specific and measurable, and so is suitable for probability calculations.\nA number of such studies on the efficacy of prayer have been undertaken, although only a few are sufficiently scientifically rigorous to be able to draw any real conclusions. The largest and best monitored study was the STEP (Study of the Therapeutic Effects of intercessory Prayer) project, based at Harvard University, and conducted in 2006.2 It involved 1802 coronary bypass surgery patients at six hospitals who were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 601 received prayers after being informed they would receive prayers; 597 did not receive prayers after being informed they may or may not receive prayers; and the remaining 604 received prayers after being informed they may or may not receive prayers. It was a double-blind study in that everyone in contact with the patients were unaware of each patient’s group assignment throughout the study, and the patients in groups 2 and 3 were unaware of whether they were receiving prayers or not. The prayers were provided for 14 days, starting the night after their surgery, by members of three Christian churches. Those praying were given the first name and last initial of the persons they were praying for, and asked to include in their prayers the phrase “for a successful surgery with a quick, healthy recovery and no complications”. All patients were followed up to determine whether any complication, any major event, or death had occurred within 30 days of surgery. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of mortality or major events, but a slightly increased incidence of complications in the group who were prayed for and knew they were being prayed for. The authors of the study speculated that the people knowing they were being prayed for may have unconsciously thought they were sicker than they really were, and that this affected the incidence of complications they reported.\nNow it might be argued that the particular experimental design in the STEP project is not how prayer works. So how does it work? Does God only answer prayers for people you know? There are biblical counter-examples such as Elisha praying for the Syrian army to be blinded (2 Kings 6:18) and when Jesus healed the centurion’s servant (Luke 7:1–10). Or does God only answer prayers when the efficacy of prayer is not being measured? If that is the case, then prayer ceases to provide any possible evidence for God. Or does God only answer prayers when you already believe that prayer works? Again, that means that prayer ceases to provide any evidence.\nI have not found a single scientific study of prayer which convincingly demonstrates that it works. A few studies have allegedly shown some small positive effects of prayer, but almost all of these have been methodologically flawed. Some have even been fraudulent."

It is reassuring to think that we can pray to some unseen force and effect change.

I know people whose children nearly died from simple infections, because they chose to pray rather than take their children to a doctor.\nIt now seems to me that prayers are never answered in the sense of a God intervening to alter events. The book of James says “The prayer of a righteous person has great effectiveness.” (James 5:16). But my experience, and the evidence I have been able to find, is that prayers do nothing at all to affect the random hands that life deals us.\nNevertheless, the act of praying provides reassurance in sharing our deepest thoughts and concerns with someone we imagine might be able to help.

God does not save godly people from every danger, and plenty of godly people have broken bones. The Psalm was written by David after he had managed to escape from trouble when in King Abimelech’s household1 He was delighted to escape, attributed his deliverance to God, and wrote the psalm in response. It seems he also assumed that such deliverance was available to other people too.\nBut in other Psalms he is not so optimistic. For example, he says\n\n“Those who anticipate my defeat attack me all day long. Indeed, many are fighting against me” (Psalm 56:2); “My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?” (Psalm 22:1); and “The roof of my mouth is as dry as a piece of pottery; my tongue sticks to my gums. You set me in the dust of death.” (Psalm 22:15).\n\nIt might seem harmless enough to thank God for deliverance from trouble, but it carries some serious implications about the God who is believed to be in control. You see, when we thank God for protecting us from harm, we are also saying that he has not protected some other people. That somehow we are special and favoured, and that others are not. More than that, we are saying that God mysteriously (randomly?) selects some to survive, and some to suffer or die. A miraculously intervening God is also an unjust capricious God, sparing some and saving others, apparently on a whim."

But the book of Job clearly says that the perspective of punishment is wrong, and Jesus also rejects it (Luke 13:1–5). Tragedy does not strike the worst sinners more often — it affects us all equally.\nAnother attempt to resolve the issue is simply to say that God knows best. He has the bigger picture in mind, he can see into the future, and when things appear mysterious to us, we are simply incapable of understanding the mind and perspective of God.

However, I can predict with remarkable accuracy the road toll each year, the number of people who will be struck by lightning, the number of people who will be killed by shark attacks, and so on. Each of these causes of death has a certain rate of occurrence that is quite predictable.\nIt is not just the number of deaths that is predictable, it is the whole probability distribution of deaths that is predictable. If you know the average number of deaths by car accidents in a city, then it is possible to calculate all the percentiles for that city. For example, you can estimate the numbers of deaths that would be exceeded only once every ten years. When you do this for many cities, you find that the 1-in-10-year extremes are exceeded in approximately 10% of cities each year. This is exactly what you would expect if the world was random, but not what you would expect if anyone was in control.\nCar accidents, diseases, and industrial accidents all follow the same probability distribution, known as the “Poisson distribution”.234 The Poisson probability distribution is based on the assumption that accidents happen randomly. It is simply not possible for tragedies to appear to follow the Poisson probability distribution while actually being controlled by God. Any interventions of God that interfere in the random processes would be detectable.5 If they are not detectable, then they are random and God is not involved.\nIf we accept that the world is random, and that bad things happen to everyone by chance, where does that leave God?

For example,\n\n10 So I, the Lord, tell you not to be afraid, you descendants of Jacob, my servants. Do not be terrified, people of Israel. For I will rescue you and your descendants from a faraway land where you are captives. The descendants of Jacob will return to their land and enjoy peace. They will be secure and no one will terrify them. 11 For I, the Lord, affirm that I will be with you and will rescue you. I will completely destroy all the nations where I scattered you. But I will not completely destroy you. I will indeed discipline you, but only in due measure. I will not allow you to go entirely unpunished. (Jeremiah 30:10–11)\n\nI first doubted that these were genuine prophecies of twentieth century events when I realized that all of the prophecies concerning the return of Israel were written during the time of the Babylonian captivity. Jeremiah was writing from Jerusalem while Judah was in Babylon; Ezekiel was writing as a captive in Babylon; and Deuteronomy is also thought to have been written around the same time, or even later.1 So at the time the prophecies were first written, Judah was in captivity in Babylon, and Israel had been taken captive by the Assyrians. To the people at the time, the original recipients of these prophecies, the clear meaning was that they would return to the land from which they were taken. Jeremiah and Ezekiel appear to have been writing to encourage the people to remain hopeful and optimistic — better times were around the corner, the Messiah was coming, and Israel would be powerful and prosperous. Of course, while the people did return to their land, along with all other ethnic groups living in captivity when the Persians came to power, the Messiah did not come and the promised power and prosperity did not occur.\nEven if we take the prophecies as having two fulfilments, and allow for a later 20th century application of these prophecies as well as a partial initial fulfilment in the return from captivity, the details do not fit any better. There is no hint in the prophecies that they referred to a much later time and a much later captivity. We only read them with that perspective in hindsight. Moreover, they describe a time of peace, a return to Yahweh worship, and a Messiah, none of which is true for the last 70 years.\nIt is perhaps surprising that the prophecies can be made to fit 20th century events as well as they do. Yet there is also an element of circularity here. It appears that the encouragement provided by Jeremiah and Ezekiel to their exiled people was appropriated by Zionists in the 20th century. Some of the early Zionists thought to return to Israel because of the prophecies, not necessarily because they believed they were inspired or prophetic, but because they saw them as an historical precedent. The first Israeli prime-minister, David Ben Gurion, wrote of the Tanach (the Hebrew Bible):2\n\nEver since I came to the land, I was shaped by Tanach, since only here could I begin to fully grasp its rich depth; it influenced me more than any other book or literature, Jewish and non-Jewish …\n\nThe establishment of the state and the war of independence shone a new light on the Tanach, … [particularly] the stories of the fathers, the coming out of Egypt, the conquest followed by living on the land,…\n\nwithout knowing the Tanach, we cannot have … an understanding of our origin, our spirit, our life-mission and our future.\n\nThe current prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said3\n\nIn our time the Biblical prophecies are being realized. As the prophet Amos said, they shall rebuild ruined cities and inhabit them. They shall plant vineyards and drink their wine. They shall till gardens and eat their fruit. And I will plant them upon their soil never to be uprooted again. Ladies and gentlemen, the people of Israel have come home never to be uprooted again.\n\nSo the apparent “fit” of 20th century events to some aspects of the biblical prophecies is not quite the coincidence that it might seem.\nIn any case, the prophecies only fit the events of the last 70 years superficially. If the 20th century fulfilment is to be convincing, the details must also be correct. This is where the prophecies as evidence fail, because there are many details that are simply untrue. As 1948 (when modern Israel was founded) fades from memory, so does the credibility of the alleged “prophecy”. For example, the prophecies repeatedly emphasise that the return of Israel would be followed by a time of peace and security. Patently, that has not happened. When challenged, believers will say that the times of peace and security are coming when the Messiah returns. In that way, all unfulfilled prophecies are neatly assigned to the future, and the prophecies become unfalsifiable.\nAll that remains is an interesting historical parallel, whereby a small part of the total Jewish population has returned to their ancient homeland, just as they did over 2,500 years ago. But nothing else in the prophecies has been fulfilled in either return: the Jews do not enjoy peace and security; the nations in which they lived have not been destroyed; the Messiah has not returned."

    "section": "Daniel’s prophecies of four empires",
    "text": "Daniel’s prophecies of four empires\nNebuchadnezzar’s dream of a giant statue representing four major empires is an apparently impressive example of history foretold in advance. The golden head represented Babylon, the chest and arms of silver represented the Medes and Persians, the belly and thighs of bronze represented the Greeks, while the iron legs were representative of the Roman empire. Finally, the feet of iron and clay represented the mixed nations at the time of the second coming of Jesus.\nThere are a few problems with this vision that are often skipped over. For example, the empire after Babylon was Persian, not Medo-Persian. The Medes were conquered by the Persians in 550 BC by Cyrus the Great. It makes as much sense to call the empire “Medo-Persian” as it does to call it “Babylo-Persian”. But if we just called it the Persian empire, then it wouldn’t fit the two arms of the image.\nThe image is also completely out of proportion chronologically. The Roman empire petered out some time after AD 400. So, by this interpretation, the “mixed nations” of the feet occupy a longer time than rest of the image combined, which seems a stretch of credibility as well as anatomy. One attempt to avoid this problem is to only consider the time when Israel actually occupied the land, thereby conveniently removing the period from AD 70 to 1948. However, this will not do either, as it would also require the image to be headless, as Israel was removed from their land during the Babylonian period.\nA further problem is that the supposed “major empires” do not include the most powerful or the largest empires in human history. In terms of size, the British empire, French empire, Russian empire, Ottoman empire, Spanish empire, Portuguese empire, Mongol empire, Qing dynasty, and Yuan dynasty are all larger than any of those assumed to be predicted by Daniel. If it is suggested that the empires in Daniel’s prophecy are only those that controlled Israel’s land, then it should include at least the British and the Ottoman empires.\nBut probably the most devastating problem concerns the date of Daniel. There is good evidence that Daniel was written during the time of Antiochus Epiphanes in the 2nd century BC, and not by some captive in Babylon in the 6th century BC. For example:\n\nDaniel is not part of the group of prophets in the Hebrew Bible; it is found in the section known as “Writings” instead. This suggests that it appeared after the canon for the prophetic books had closed (usually considered to be around 200 BC).\nThe apocryphal book known as the Wisdom of Sirach dates from about 180 BC, and does not quote Daniel, although it does quote almost every other book of the Old Testament. On the other hand, copies of Daniel have been found at Qumran, and it is cited by later second century BC documents such as the Sibylline Oracles4. Again, this suggests a second century date for Daniel.\nDaniel 11 strongly suggests that the book was written around the time of Antiochus Epiphanes. It is a “prophecy” that describes in detail the history of the Seleucids from about 300 to 165 BC. This section accurately corresponds to what is known from Greek historical writings of the period. But then, from about Daniel 11:40, the historical details stop and nothing described from that point on has occurred. There is no gap in the narrative to suggest that there is a large time gap; instead, the prophecy continues to describe the same king (Antiochus Epiphanes) as in the previous verses. Despite describing the kings up to Antiochus Epiphanes accurately, and describing the early part of the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes, the prophecy fails to mention the most significant events of his reign — namely the recapture of Jerusalem by the Maccabees and the rededication of the temple. Thus, it is highly likely that this chapter was written in 165 BC, during the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes but before the Maccabean uprising.\nThere are historical inaccuracies about the Babylonian period: Belshazzar is described as the son of Nebuchadnezzar rather than Nabonidus (Dan 5:11); Darius the Mede is regarded as responsible for the conquest of Babylon rather than Cyrus the Persian (Dan 5:31; 6:28); and so on.\nThere are many Persian and Greek loan-words that would have been unknown to someone writing in the Babylonian period.\n\nIt seems inescapable that the book of Daniel is not what it purports to be. It is written as if it is a prophecy penned by Daniel, a Jewish exile in captivity in Babylon, but all the evidence suggests that at least part of it was written around 165 BC by an unknown Jew after the temple had been desecrated by Antiochus Epiphanes.\nThis also explains why the prophecy of four beasts in Daniel 7 is accurate for the first three beasts, but the fourth “terrible” beast does not accurately describe the Roman empire. It was easy for the writer of Daniel 7 to describe the history of the Babylonian, Persian and Greek empires, because they had already happened. The terrible fourth empire was most likely intended to refer to Antiochus Epiphanes, and the purpose of the prophecy was to encourage the Jews by promising divine salvation from the oppression they were enduring. Instead, Judas Maccabeus led a revolt against Antiochus and his Seleucid army — something the writer did not expect.\nThe great prophecies of Daniel are only impressive evidence for the inspiration of the Bible if they were written before the events they describe, and that seems extremely unlikely. The book is accurate about recent history (300–165 BC), muddled about earlier history (the Babylonian and Persian periods), and completely wrong about what would happen next (the Maccabean revolt). That is what you would expect from something written by a human being. It is not what you would expect if God had anything to do with it."

    "section": "The destruction of Tyre",
    "text": "The destruction of Tyre\nAnother famous prophecy that is often used as evidence for the divine origin of the Bible is Ezekiel’s description of the overthrow of Tyre in chapter 26. It describes the complete destruction of the city of Tyre.\n\n7 “For this is what the sovereign Lord  says: Take note that I am about to bring King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, king of kings, against Tyre from the north, with horses, chariots, and horsemen, an army and hordes of people. 8 He will kill your daughters in the field with the sword. He will build a siege wall against you, erect a siege ramp against you, and raise a great shield against you. 9 He will direct the blows of his battering rams against your walls and tear down your towers with his weapons. 10 He will cover you with the dust kicked up by his many horses. Your walls will shake from the noise of the horsemen, wheels, and chariots when he enters your gates like those who invade through a city’s broken walls. 11 With his horses’ hoofs he will trample all your streets. He will kill your people with the sword, and your strong pillars will tumble down to the ground. 12 They will steal your wealth and loot your merchandise. They will tear down your walls and destroy your luxurious homes. Your stones, your trees, and your soil he will throw into the water. 13 I will silence the noise of your songs; the sound of your harps will be heard no more. 14 I will make you a bare rock; you will be a place where fishing nets are spread. You will never be built again, for I, the Lord, have spoken, declares the sovereign Lord. (Ezekiel 26:7-14)\n\nI have used this prophecy in several talks I’ve given on Bible inspiration. This is how I used to explain it.\n\nThere were two cities called “Tyre”, one on the mainland and one on a small island about 500m off the coast. Between 585 and 573 BC, Nebuchadnezzar undertook a 13-year siege of Tyre and succeeded in capturing the mainland city. Two hundred and fifty years later, Alexander the Great used the rubble from the ruins of mainland Tyre to construct a causeway to the island. After a 7-month siege, he succeeded in capturing the island city. Mainland Tyre was never rebuilt and fishermen today use the site to spread their nets.\n\nBut that is not actually what was predicted, and some of the details are not even true.\n\nThe mainland settlement was called Ushu, not Tyre. Only the island was called Tyre.\nNebuchadnezzar did not defeat Tyre. His 13-year siege against the island ended in failure.\nThe prophecy carefully distinguishes the “daughters on the mainland” from Tyre itself; so it is incorrect to claim that the first part of the prophecy is about the mainland city rather than the island city.\nTyre itself (the island) was never scraped clean and the rock is far beneath many strata of settlement.\nAlexander’s conquest did not wipe out the population of Tyre, and Alexander even allowed a man of Tyre to become its new king (Diodorus 17.47.1–6).\nSeventeen years later, Tyre had recovered sufficiently to resist a siege by Antigonus, one of Alexander’s generals for 15 months. He established his own garrison there.\nModern Tyre is a thriving city, the fourth largest in Lebanon, and is far from silent.\nThe mainland site of Ushu has traditionally been identified with a small unexcavated mound about four kilometres south of Tyre known as Tel Rachidiyeh. The much larger settlement mound of Tel el-Mashouk has also been proposed.5 Neither site is a “bare rock” and neither is used for spreading fishing nets.\n\nFurther, Ezekiel himself admitted that this prophecy did not come true:\n\nSon of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made his army labor hard against Tyre. Every head was made bald, and every shoulder was rubbed bare, yet neither he nor his army got anything from Tyre to pay for the labor that he had performed against her. (Ezekiel 29:18)\n\nAs with many believers who use prophecy to support the inspiration of the Bible, I was so keen to have a clear fulfilment that I fudged the facts a little to make them fit. I’m sorry to have misled people in this way."

    "section": "Prophecies about Jesus",
    "text": "Prophecies about Jesus\nSeveral Old Testament prophecies about Jesus seem remarkably prescient.\nIsaiah 7 refers to a virgin birth:\n\nTherefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. (Isaiah 7:14 ESV)\n\nPsalm 22 appears to predict his crucifixion:\n\n14 My strength drains away like water; all my bones are dislocated; my heart is like wax; it melts away inside me. 15 The roof of my mouth is as dry as a piece of pottery; my tongue sticks to my gums. You set me in the dust of death. 16 Yes, wild dogs surround me— a gang of evil men crowd around me; like a lion they pin my hands and feet. 17 I can count all my bones; my enemies are gloating over me in triumph. 18 They are dividing up my clothes among themselves; they are rolling dice for my garments. (Psalm 22:14–18)\n\nIsaiah 53 describes his atoning death:\n\n5 He was wounded because of our rebellious deeds, crushed because of our sins; he endured punishment that made us well; because of his wounds we have been healed. 6 All of us had wandered off like sheep; each of us had strayed off on his own path, but the Lord caused the sin of all of us to attack him. 7 He was treated harshly and afflicted, but he did not even open his mouth. Like a lamb led to the slaughtering block, like a sheep silent before her shearers, he did not even open his mouth. 8 He was led away after an unjust trial— but who even cared? Indeed, he was cut off from the land of the living; because of the rebellion of his own people he was wounded. 9 They intended to bury him with criminals, but he ended up in a rich man’s tomb, because he had committed no violent deeds, nor had he spoken deceitfully. (Isaiah 53:5–9)\n\nThere is no doubt that these words were written before Jesus was born as they have been found on manuscripts in the caves of Qumran amongst the Dead Sea Scrolls.\nThe problem here is that the prophets who wrote these words were not thinking about a Messiah at all. For example, the virgin birth prophecy is clearly about contemporary events concerning King Ahaz. The next two verses after v14 quoted above are:\n\n15 He shall eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good. 16 For before the boy knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you dread will be deserted. (Isaiah 7:15–16)\n\nEven the word translated “virgin” in v14 probably referred to a young woman rather than specifically to a virgin, and it is translated that way in some modern versions (e.g., NET, RSV, NRSV).\nPsalm 22 and Isaiah 53 both describe a suffering servant of God, persecuted and apparently killed by his enemies. There is nothing in these passages to suggest that they were referring to the Messiah or the Son of God. It is only after reading the New Testament that they appear to be prophecies of Jesus.\nThe writers of the New Testament were attempting to establish the credentials of Jesus as a legitimate Messiah. So finding Old Testament passages that fitted his life was a useful strategy. In places (e.g., Matthew 2:15), non-prophecies have clearly been elevated to prophetic status, just so they can be “fulfilled”.\nAn alternative related strategy would be to fabricate details in Jesus life so that he appeared to fulfil Old Testament prophecies. Unfortunately, we know nothing about Jesus apart from what is in the gospels, so there are no independent corroborating witnesses. It is hard to say which parts of these quotations (and others like them) were prophetic, and which parts of the Jesus story were back-crafted to match prophetic-sounding words from the Old Testament. In fact, many of the apparent contradictions between the Gospels regarding the nativity stories, genealogies, and some other events, seem to clash specifically because the authors were trying to ‘fulfill’ different (and incompatible) prophecies.\nWe can choose to take on face-value what the gospel writers wrote, but then we are taking a leap of faith rather than finding evidence."

    "section": "Probabilities and prophecies",
    "text": "Probabilities and prophecies\nSometimes people try to assign probabilities to prophecies, and arrive at a tiny number which is then claimed to be evidence for the prophecy being divinely inspired. I have never used this argument because there are serious mathematical problems with it. First, you have to be able to quantify the probability of each aspect of the prophecy. Second, you must then assume that all elements of the prophecy are independent of each other. Both steps are problematic.\nIt is almost never possible to quantify the probability of a discrete prophetic event. For example, what is the probability that Alexander the Great would create a causeway to the island of Tyre from the mainland rubble? Even if we assume that the prophecy of Ezekiel intended to refer to this event (which I doubt, as previously explained), it is not possible to assign a number to the probability. Is it 20%, or 5%, or 83%? In this context, a probability refers to the proportion of times something would happen if the circumstances were repeated a large number of times. But as we have only one occurrence of it, we can only guess what would have happened if the circumstances arose again at some other identical island in another location. Since Alexander the Great did it the first time, a reasonable suggestion is that he would have done it again in identical circumstances, and then the probability would be 100%.\nOnce numbers are allocated to the various components of a prophecy, they are then multiplied together to give the probability of the complete prophecy. This works for coin tosses — the probability of three heads in three tosses is 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.125. But it assumes that the components are independent — that is that the outcome of each component has no bearing on the other components. For coin tosses, that is true: the first head does not affect whether the second or third coin toss will be a head. But it is not true for prophecies. Alexander the Great could not have thrown the rubble into the sea if Nebuchadnezzar had not created the rubble in the first place. So it is incorrect to multiply the probability of Nebuchadnezzar destroying the mainland settlement by the probability of Alexander throwing the rubble into the sea. One event affects the next event, and so the probability of the two events together is not simply obtained by multiplying the probabilities of each event.\nI once saw some Bible course notes that used this probabilistic argument for prophecy. So I raised the above objections and asked that the offending section of notes be removed. I was told that the argument should be retained because it was impressive, even if it was wrong, and that the people attending the course would not know the argument made no mathematical sense in any case. I was shocked that believers would knowingly lie for the sake of conversion. Sadly, the notes are still in use, and the argument is still being used."

    "text": "Unfulfilled prophecies\nWhen a biblical prophet says “Thus says the Lord …” it seems reasonable to assume that the message comes directly from God and that it should be true and accurate in every respect. So what should we make of unfulfilled prophecies? Many of these are explained away as “not yet fulfilled” although that cannot apply to all of them.\nOne of the most famous unfulfilled prophecies is from Ezekiel who describes Egypt becoming “a desolation and waste” (Ezekiel 29:9; 30:7) and being uninhabited for forty years (Ezekiel 29:11,13). There is a clay tablet in the British Museum6 that states\n\nIn the 37th year of Nebuchadrezzar, King of Babylon, he went to Mizraim [Egypt] to make war. AMASIS, King of Mizraim, collected [his army] and marched and spread abroad.\n\nHowever, it is not specified whether the armies actually engaged in battle, and if they did, who won. Further, there is plenty of Egyptian evidence of ongoing activity in the following years, suggesting that they were far from desolate. We know the names of all of the Pharaohs during this period, and have inscriptions about them. Herodotus7 describes Egypt during the reign of Amasis II (570–526 BC) as wealthy and prosperous. Whether Herodotus can be trusted or not, it seems impossible that Egypt was uninhabited for any period of time, let alone forty years.\nThere are many more prophecies whose alleged fulfillment is only recorded in the Bible, so there is no corroborating evidence. Without external evidence, a “fulfilled” prophecy contributes nothing to the case for or against the Bible."

    "text": "Harmonizing the accounts\nThe resurrection accounts are notoriously difficult to harmonize. One correspondent sent the following questions to me:\n\nDid one, two or three women come to the tomb? Was it “while it was still dark” or “just after sunrise”? Did they come to “look at the tomb” or “to anoint the body with spices”? Did they see one angel, two angels, a man dressed in white, or Jesus himself? Was it a quiet angel sitting or a loud flying angel booming like thunder and lightning? Who saw the resurrected Jesus first: Peter or Mary Magdalene? What did they do as they left the tomb — did they say “nothing to anyone” or did they run “to tell his disciples”? Was the stone rolled away in the presence of the women or before they arrived? Was Jesus on his way to Galilee by the time the women arrived, or was he in Jerusalem on the first Easter Sunday? Luke says that the disciples “stayed continually in the temple” because Jesus told them to wait in Jerusalem until they had been “clothed with power from on high” but John has the disciples returning to their fishing trade in Galilee. John’s order of appearances doesn’t square up with Paul’s. Does Jesus’ ascension take place in Bethany on the same day of his resurrection as in Luke? Or does it take place on the Mount of Olives forty days after his resurrection as in Acts?\n\nFurther questions could easily be added. It is almost impossible to come up with some sequence of events that is consistent with what the gospels say occurred. There have been many heroic attempts to solve the problem; the best I’ve seen is by Oxford academic, John Wenham1. All such harmonizations assume that each account is true but only provides part of the story. It is as if a jigsaw has been shaken and the pieces randomly assigned to four different boxes. The game of harmonization is to put the pieces back together.\nHowever, parallel narratives do not work like that. Instead, we would expect to see substantial overlap with many features in common, and with some additional (but possibly unimportant) details that are unique to each record.\nThe only way four writers of the same events could come up with four such disparate accounts as the gospels is by careful collusion as to who would leave what parts out in order to create the great harmonization puzzle for future generations. Even allowing for different norms regarding historical narratives, it beggars belief that these four gospels are both accurate and reporting the same events. It is far more likely that they represent different oral traditions, or possibly the four writers added different imaginary elements to give the stories more detail and color."

    "text": "A growing legend\nThe gospels were not written immediately after the events they claim to record. Instead they appeared between 30 and 80 years later, and were probably partly based on verbal accounts that had been recounted for a few decades.\nIt is possible to reconstruct the evolution of the resurrection accounts by noting when each of the gospel writers is thought to have penned their account, and carefully observing what each of them included (or, more importantly, excluded).\nThe main resurrection stories can be dated as follows.2\n\n\n\n\n\nPassage\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\nApproximate date\n\n\n\n\n1 Corinthians 15:3–8\n\n\nPaul\n\n\n53–55\n\n\n\n\nMark 16\n\n\nMark\n\n\n65–70\n\n\n\n\nMatthew 28\n\n\nMatthew\n\n\n80–85\n\n\n\n\nLuke 24\n\n\nLuke\n\n\n80–85\n\n\n\n\nJohn 20–21\n\n\nJohn\n\n\n90–110\n\n\n\n\n\nThus it is more than twenty years after the crucifixion that we have any record of someone claiming that Jesus had been seen alive after his death. But Paul wasn’t claiming to have seen Jesus himself — he is reporting second-hand accounts. Paul never claimed to see Jesus alive himself, even on the road to Damascus where he says he saw a “bright light” and heard a voice.\nAssuming Mark wrote the gospel traditionally associated with his name, then he is the first person claiming to be an eye-witness to the events recorded. However, his gospel contains no resurrection appearances. It originally finished at Mark 16:8, as noted in all modern Bibles. The section from v9–20 does not appear in the earliest manuscripts and is thought to be a later addition. The original gospel included a statement that Jesus had risen, but it contained no resurrection appearances. An early reader of Mark would have been left with the image of an empty tomb and an angel claiming that Jesus had risen. (Some time later, someone added the ending to Mark including several resurrection appearances.)\nThen we have Matthew and Luke, probably written around AD 80, fifty years after Jesus died. Luke never claimed to be an eyewitness himself — he was passing on reports he had collated. Unfortunately his reports contradict those in Matthew’s gospel. Assuming Matthew wrote the gospel associated with his name, then he is the first person claiming to be an eye-witness to the events recorded. However, he also includes several things that discredit him as a reliable historical witness (such as the notorious “zombie” episode of Matthew 27:52–53).\nFinally, John wrote at least sixty years after Jesus died and long after almost everyone who could have confirmed his record had died. His record of the resurrection appearances is completely different from those of the other gospel writers.\nIf there were any eyewitness accounts in the first fifty years after Jesus died, they have been lost. There aren’t any references to Jesus at all outside the Bible until Josephus in the 90s, and even they have been partially amended by Christians in the subsequent centuries.\nPutting the various written accounts together, it looks like Mark’s gospel reflected a belief that Jesus lived on, and this was later embellished with alleged post-resurrection appearances. The fact that these came so long after Jesus died greatly diminishes their value and validity, and the striking contradictions between the records suggests that each writer embellished the story in his own way.\nFurther support for this perspective can be found by looking at how the stories grew over time. In Paul’s version there are no angelic messengers, no earthquakes, no walking through walls, no bodily ascension; there is not even a tomb or a physical body mentioned. By the time of Mark’s gospel, we have one angel present, and a tomb with a rolling stone, but still no earthquakes, post-mortem appearances and no ascension. Matthew adds the earthquake, the bizarre appearance of additional dead people, and two post-mortem appearances. Luke chimes in with an additional angel and some new appearances of Jesus, and the first report of a bodily ascension. Finally, John adds further appearances, the walking-through-walls miracles, and the fish miracle. It is a growing legend, embellished at each re-telling.\nIt is also interesting to realise that there were resurrection accounts of other people, mentioned for example by Pliny the Elder. So the idea was circulating at the time, and appears to have been seized on by the early Christians to bolster their claims."

    "text": "Confirmation bias\nLooking back, I wonder why I held on to this argument for so long. Like many believers, I suffered from confirmation bias. I wanted to believe, and I seized on anything that looked like evidence to support my belief. Once I was finally able to assess the evidence without trying to make it fit my beliefs, I realised how weak the case for the resurrection really is.\nIt is amazing what people will believe if they want to. I have corresponded with dozens of Mormons about their often bizarre beliefs. How could intelligent and rational people believe that the angel Moroni gave Joseph Smith gold tablets inscribed with the Book of Mormon, when there is no supporting evidence, not even the gold tablets? But millions of people do believe this — because they want to believe, and the human mind is capable of finding apparent support for beliefs, no matter how strange. There is even a “peer-reviewed” academic journal supporting Book of Mormon studies.3\nEven more people believe that the Quran was miraculously revealed to the illiterate Muhammad while he sat in a cave in Arabia in the 7th century. Islamic apologists attempt to marshall “evidence” in support of their beliefs, as do Mormon apologists and evangelical Christian apologists. The beliefs come first, and then evidence to support the beliefs is sought. It gives an illusion of rational argument and scholarship, but it only convinces those who want to believe.\nThe resurrection accounts are often approached in the same way. But the biblical records are contradictory, and evidence outside the Bible is non-existent. Without the resurrection of Jesus, Christianity loses all power — he is not coming back, there is no kingdom of God, and there is no mediator between us and God."

I found that confusing. I was aware that the light from the nearest galaxy to our own took at least a few tens of thousands of years to get here, and the light from many other galaxies took millions of years to arrive. So almost everything visible in the night sky must be a lot older than my Sunday School teacher claimed. He also claimed that radio-carbon dating was flawed, that continental drift had happened in a couple of thousand years, that the Grand Canyon was formed by the flood, and that all the animal species that existed managed to squeeze into Noah’s ark (apart from the dinosaurs who missed out for some reason)."

    "text": "Ancient creation\nBy my mid-teens, I had figured out that I knew a lot more about science than my Sunday School teacher, and that much of what he claimed was nonsense. Then I read Creation vs Evolution: Facts and fallacies by Alan Hayward, a real scientist with a PhD in experimental physics. He made much more sense — arguing that God had initiated creation a few billion years ago, and that it had taken a very long time to reach the stage where it was ready for human beings. The days of Genesis 1 were days on which God commanded (“Let there be …”), but the angels were given a great deal of time to carry out those commands. Then, in the last 10,000 years, God had created Adam and Eve, and the human race began. Hayward argued that early hominids were some kind of species of ape, and that the biblical record only began with the creation of human beings. The flood was local to a region near Mesopotamia, and the animals on the ark were intended to be representative rather than a complete selection.1 I found these views very satisfying and adopted them as my own. I could be a scientist and a Bible-believing Christian.\nAfter finishing a science degree at the University of Melbourne (primarily in mathematics and statistics), I started a PhD. While I was a doctoral student, I became involved in some public debates on creation and evolution with the Australian Skeptics. They expected us to argue about the age of the universe (like my Sunday School teacher), but we concentrated on design arguments and the origin of life, happily agreeing that life was ancient and claiming that this did not contradict the Bible. Essentially, we argued that there were some remarkable designs in the biological world that could not have come about by a process of slow evolution, and that science had no explanation for biogenesis (the origin of life itself). The Skeptics valiantly tried to engage us on subjects other than the agreed topic, but we refused to bite, thus avoiding discussion of the Bible, of the silly anti-science arguments popular amongst many creationists, and of any reference to the flood. Frankly I was surprised how easily we seemed to win the debate, largely through better debating technique and carefully prepared rebuttals."

Would I still believe in creation if science could show how life could spontaneously form?\nThe problem with the arguments we had used is that they rely on a lack of alternative explanations — we cannot explain X, therefore God must have done it. People have used the argument for centuries, but for a diminishing number of phenomena. Centuries ago, thunder had no known explanation, therefore it was attributed to God. Blindness had no known explanation, therefore it was attributed to God (or demons). The inability to conceive a baby had no known explanation, therefore it was attributed to God. Now, we can explain thunder, blindness and infertility, and most people do not resort to blaming God. But we continue to use the same argument for things we cannot explain — biogenesis, apparent coincidences, human birth, beauty, symbiotic relationships, …. Once something has an alternative explanation, we drop it from the list of “Evidence for God”, but continue to use the same argument for the remaining things we cannot explain.

    "text": "Early humans\nAfter I completed my PhD, I worked as a statistical consultant, assisting researchers in many different fields with analysing and interpreting the data they had collected. I worked with hundreds of researchers from every imaginable discipline — with ecologists on the Arctic lemming population, with engineers on the reliability of bridge pylons, with surgeons on blood clotting, with hydrologists on stream bed ripples, and so on.\nOne day, a paleobotanist came to me needing assistance with analysing the species present in the ancient remains of aboriginal camp fires. I took the opportunity to quiz him on the reliability of the dating mechanisms used, and the range of uncertainty that was possible. He informed me that the data I was analysing came from camp fires that had burnt between 40,000 and 60,000 years ago. There was no way that the fires could have been more recent. That left me with a problem: there was no way that the biblical record of Adam and Eve could be pushed back that far, even allowing for genealogical gaps.2\nSo who were these people who lit fires in Australia so long ago, and are modern indigenous people descended from them? Although there are few cultural identifiers, what we have (e.g., rock art) suggests that the Australian aboriginal population has continuously occupied the continent since first arriving at least 40,000 years ago. Clearly Australian aborigines could not be descendants of Adam and Eve.\nBut if Australian aborigines are not descendants of Adam and Eve, then not all human beings are descendants of Adam and Eve. Once I accepted that point, questions flooded in. Why then was it necessary to argue that early hominids were not human? What then should we make of Genesis claiming that Eve was the “mother of all the living” (Genesis 3:20). How should we understand Paul’s statements that Adam was the “first man” (1 Corinthians 15:45) and that he introduced death into the world (Romans 5:12–14)?\nOn the other hand, there are several biblical hints that there were other human beings in existence at the time of Adam and Eve:\n\nEve is told “I will greatly increase your labor pains” (Genesis 3:16). If she was the first human woman, then no human had ever experienced childbirth. So the pains could hardly be increased — they didn’t even exist. But if other humans had been having children, then the curse makes sense.\nCain is afraid he would be killed (Genesis 4:14–15). Who could Cain be afraid of if the only other people on earth are his parents, and perhaps a younger sibling or two that are not mentioned in the Bible? It sounds like there are hordes of other people that may be hostile to him.\nCain finds a wife and builds a city (Genesis 4:17). Who is he married to? A sister? And who lived in his city? Surely more than Cain, his wife and son Enoch! The text appears to assume the existence of a large number of other people in the area.\nAfter Adam and Eve’s first grandchild was born, “people began to worship the Lord” (Genesis 4:26). If the only human beings were Adam and Eve, their children and grandchildren, it makes no sense to say that “people began to worship the Lord”. Abel had previously been faithful, and it appears that Adam and Eve remained faithful after they left Eden (see Genesis 4:25). So at least some of the family were already worshipping God. The verse only really makes sense if these people are those who were not part of the family of Adam and Eve.\n\nSo throughout the early chapters of Genesis, there are many hints of a wider human population that existed at the time. Cain apparently married into these other humans, and so did Adam and Eve’s other descendants."

The draft genome sequence was released in 2001 and provided some astonishing links between human beings and other primates.\nAbout 20% of the human genome was found to consist of pseudogenes (also called “junk DNA”); these are defective genes that are caused by mutations and which serve no function. The curious thing is that many of these pseudogenes are shared by primates, and have exactly the same mutation that renders them incapable of functioning.\nTo take one example, there is a gene that aids in the biosynthesis of vitamin C that occurs in many mammals including some primates. The gene is present but a mutation has disabled it in humans and in some other primates. Biologists have conjectured that species which have lost the ability to synthesise vitamin C may have an advantage in that they can gain weight and fat more easily from fructose — a survival advantage in an environment with a shortage of food supplies.3 This particular mutation is present in many primates and all human beings. If there was only one such pseudogene, it might be a coincidence. However, there are so many of them, that together they provide overwhelming evidence that we share a genetic heritage with modern primates."

I concluded that Adam was the first human being to whom God revealed himself, the first one to have any kind of relationship with his creator. He was the first person to whom God gave instructions, and so the first one who was capable of sinning. Similarly, Eve became the mother of all those spiritually alive (Genesis 3:20). I made sense of Paul’s writings by concluding that death through sin entered the world when Adam and Eve sinned. Before that, death was only ever due to natural mortality.\nIt seems highly unlikely that the original biblical authors intended to say what I interpreted them to say, but it was a way of trying to maintain some kind of religious faith that did not contradict scientific observations. The Genesis creation became little more than a founding myth, providing meaning to our existence and establishing a sense of who we are in the wider context of the world.\nThe problem with reaching this conclusion is that it raises questions about the rest of scripture. Was Abraham also mythical? What about Moses, or David? If I could explain away the difficulties in Genesis by making it “spiritual” or “allegorical”, was it acceptable to do the same with other parts of the Bible that inconveniently contradicted the observations of scientists, archaeologists and historians? Was faith even falsifiable once the inconvenient parts could be allegorized?"

    "text": "I have given nearly 50 talks on biblical archaeology. One was entitled “Bible skeletons and fingerprints” in which I described some recent archaeological finds that supported and illuminated the biblical record. I showed photographs of the ossuary of Caiaphas from the first century AD, containing a skeleton of a 60 year old man — probably Caiaphas the high priest mentioned in the gospels. I covered the tiny clay seals that were found in Jerusalem from around 586BC. One of the seals belonged to Baruch, Jeremiah’s scribe, and contained a fingerprint — probably belonging to Baruch himself. Another seal belonged to King Hezekiah, and included the image of a dung beetle, an Egyptian scarab.\nMy approach was to comb the archaeological literature looking for finds that had some biblical connections, interesting photographs, and that could be explained relatively simply. The talks were popular, and the audiences were receptive to anything that showed the Bible record was accurate.\nI would display reconstructions of the temple in Jerusalem at the time of Jesus, and discuss where various events in the gospels might have taken place. I would show sketches of Capernaum, where Jesus is said to have lived, and discuss what his house must have been like, and how far it was from the synagogue.\nI was always careful to say that archaeology could not “prove the Bible”, but it could illuminate, and sometimes support, the biblical record. For example, the Bible says that Baruch was a scribe in Jerusalem at the time of the Babylonian invasion (Jeremiah 36:4) and the archaeological record corroborates the Bible statements. The reconstructions of Herod’s temple in Jerusalem add an additional dimension to the stories of Jesus told by the gospel writers.\nProvided we stick to the time of the captivity and the New Testament, there are plenty of connections between the Bible and archaeology. People and places from about 600 BC onwards are often accurately described in the Bible: Nebuchadnezzar, Cyrus, Antiochus Epiphanes, Herod the Great, Pontius Pilate, and others are mentioned, reflecting a mostly reliable history that made its way into what became the biblical books.\nIt is easy to lull audiences into a false sense of security by only covering those finds where the Bible and archaeology match, where there are no unpleasant contradictions, or inconvenient anachronisms. If you only discuss the cases where archaeology supports the biblical record, you can imagine that there are no contradictions or difficulties.\nIt was not that I was deliberately pulling the wool over the eyes of those listening to my talks. I also ignored the problems myself. I knew they existed, and I read the debates, but I reasoned that any inconsistencies between the Bible and archaeology must have a reasonable explanation, if only we had more information. So it was better to leave out those difficulties from my talks and focus on the finds where the Bible and archaeology were in agreement.\nSo in this chapter I would like to review some of the difficulties with archaeology, and consider whether they really can be explained."

The sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah.\n\nThis is simply nonsense. Ancient flutes made from bird bone and mammoth ivory have been found in a cave in southern Germany, and dated to over 40,000 years ago.1 There are several other similar finds almost as old, and the uncertainty in the dating is only of the order of a couple of thousand years. As Jubal was the great-great-great-great-great grandson of Adam (Gen 4:17–21), and Adam was 75 generations before Jesus according to Luke 3, Jubal could not possibly have lived as long as 40,000 years ago. More like 6000–8000 years ago and that’s allowing for up to 80 years per generation.\nThere is also good archaeological evidence of settlements and domesticated livestock back to about 9000 BC2 and of metalworking back to about 9500 BC3. These are far too early for Jabal and Tubal-Cain to plausibly be the true originators of camping, farming and smithing."

    "text": "The Exodus from Egypt and conquest of Canaan\nA serious difficulty for the biblical record is the lack of archaeological evidence supporting an Israelite slave class in Egypt in the second millenium BC, or indeed at any other time.\nThere are some well-known reliefs from about 1450 BC depicting Semitic-looking slaves7 although these are identified in the attached inscriptions as prisoners of war from the Pharaoh’s campaigns in the south (Nubia) and north (Syria-Canaan), rather than from Israelite families that had lived in Egypt for centuries.\nThe problem is, the name of Israel is never used before the end of the thirteenth century BC. There are plenty of documents and inscriptions where it could have been used — there are Hyksos inscriptions, Egyptian inscriptions, and the extensive fourteenth century cuneiform archive from Tel el-Amarna containing about 400 letters describing Canaan at the time. But nothing about Israel. This has led most ancient historians to conclude that Israel did not exist at the time, and only gradually emerged as a distinct group during the thirteenth century BC.\nThe places in Egypt, and on the route taken by the Israelites, reflect the geography of the first millenium BC (when the text was written) rather than the second millenium BC (when the events are supposed to have taken place). Several places that are named on the Exodus route have been identified as being unoccupied at the time of the supposed wilderness wanderings.8 For example, the earliest occupation of Ezion-Geber dates from the 8th century BC,9 more than 500 years after the Exodus is said to have occurred. Similarly, the names Goshen, Pithom, Succoth, Ramesses and Kadesh Barnea all point to the geography of the first millennium rather than the second.\nAn even more serious omission from the archaeological record is any evidence of the Canaanite invasion. The overthrow of cities, and the displacement of one culture by another, is precisely where archaeology is at its strongest. But no matter how flexible we are with the dating, there is simply no evidence of an invasion and conquest of Canaan. Instead, the archaeological evidence shows a slow transition from an agricultural society to city-kingdoms.\nConservative Christian historians, especially James Hoffmeier10 and Kenneth Kitchen11, have valiantly attempted to marshall the evidence to support the biblical account of the Exodus, and for a long time I took comfort in their books. However, eventually the weight of evidence against the Exodus account strained my faith too far.\nThe alternative explanation fits the available evidence much better — that the early history of Israel described from Genesis to Deuteronomy reflects the geography and culture of a much later time, and was constructed to provide a founding myth for Israel. It is a “history” clumsily told to bolster the claims and demands of the late kings of Judah. This would explain the impossibly large numbers of people wandering in the wilderness12, the anachronistic place names given in the Exodus record, the lack of archaeological evidence for an Israelite invasion, and the lack of reference to Israel before the late 13th century BC.\nThe Egypt story may still contain some cultural memories, but these have been embellished and exaggerated to such an extent that it is no longer possible to recover whatever core historical details there might have been."

Those details would complicate the message.\nI assumed that there was a valid explanation for each of the difficulties, but that we did not have enough information to know what they were. My faith in the biblical record was strong enough that I was prepared to use the archaeological evidence to support the Bible when convenient, and I was prepared to ignore the archaeology and history when it was not convenient.\nThis is another case of confirmation bias.

This was the first registration, taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria. (Luke 2:1–2)\n\nQuirinius is known to have been governor of Syria in AD 613, much too late for the birth of Jesus. There have been several suggested explanations: that Quirinius was an administrator for this census, but later became governor; or that some other governor started the census, but the final compilation of data was not completed until the time Quirinius was governor; or that Quirinius served as governor on two separate occasions; and so on. But none of these seem likely.\nAnother problem with this census is that there is no evidence that Roman rulers required people to be registered in the town of their ancestral lands. To require such a massive migration of people for the purpose of counting the population seems extremely unlikely and is unknown in any other Roman census for which we have some record.\nThe massacre of babies in Bethlehem is also unknown in the historical records outside the Bible. This is particularly surprising given we have a history of the time written by Josephus who otherwise took great pains to record in detail the excesses of Herod the Great, and several other massacres around the same time.\nEach problem on its own can probably be explained away.

It might excuse using later place names in the Exodus journey, but most of the other things mentioned in this chapter are not simply sloppy reporting by modern standards. Rather, they appear be part of an imagined history concocted for ideological reasons.\nBesides, if we allow for exaggeration and a large dose of historical imagination, the narrative loses all power. If we cannot believe that musical instruments were first played eight generations after Adam (Genesis 4:21), why should be believe the curses described in the previous chapter? If we cannot believe that Abraham came from Ur of the Chaldees, why should we believe the promises God made to Abraham? The New Testament gospel messages hinges on these curses and promises being reliable and accurate, and once the historicity of the biblical text cannot be assumed, the gospel message cannot be believed either."

    "text": "The death of Judas\nDuring a question session after one debate, someone in the audience asked me to explain the contradictory accounts of Judas’ death. In Matthew’s gospel we are told that Judas hanged himself (Matthew 27:5), whereas Acts says that he fell headlong and burst open and his intestines gushed out (Acts 1:18). I retorted “Perhaps the rope broke” which the largely believing audience applauded, and which left the questioner speechless. But it was not really a valid explanation. I’ve seen someone fall to their death from the twelfth story of an office block, landing on the concrete pavement below. Bodies do not burst open unless they are rotting and bloated.\nIt is not just the manner of death which differs. Here are the two accounts in full; spot the differences:\n\n3 Now when Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus had been condemned, he regretted what he had done and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders, 4 saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood!” But they said, “What is that to us? You take care of it yourself!” 5 So Judas threw the silver coins into the temple and left. Then he went out and hanged himself. 6 The chief priests took the silver and said, “It is not lawful to put this into the temple treasury, since it is blood money.” 7 After consulting together they bought the Potter’s Field with it, as a burial place for foreigners. 8 For this reason that field has been called the “Field of Blood” to this day. (Matthew 27:3–8)\n\n\n18 Now this man Judas acquired a field with the reward of his unjust deed, and falling headfirst he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out. 19 This became known to all who lived in Jerusalem, so that in their own language they called that field Hakeldama, that is, “Field of Blood.” (Acts 1:18–19)\n\nThere are some similarities, such as the fact that Judas committed suicide and that the field was called “Field of Blood”. But there are also some irreconcilable differences: who bought the field, when it was purchased, the manner of Judas’ death, and the reason for the name.\nIn classes that I taught, I would try to reconcile these accounts with an explanation that involved Judas hanging himself, then becoming bloated over several weeks before his rotting carcass disintegrated and fell to the ground. (Although he must have hung himself by the feet if he fell “headlong”.) Later, the priests bought the field with the money that Judas had thrown into the temple, and so in a sense it could be said that Judas “bought” it. I suggested that the name “Field of Blood” was appropriate because it was bought with the blood money, and because Judas died there. It is such a tortuous and unlikely explanation, that I eventually admitted to myself that I was simply trying to concoct a story to bolster my faith. In any context outside the Bible, two such stories would be recognized as contradictory accounts by unreliable witnesses.\nIt is much more likely that the two records are simply reporting different oral traditions about the death of Judas."

For example, consider the following two records of the size of David’s army.\n\nJoab reported to David the number of warriors. In all Israel there were 1,100,000 sword-wielding soldiers; Judah alone had 470,000 sword-wielding soldiers. (1 Chronicles 21:5)\n\n\nJoab reported the number of warriors to the king. In Israel there were 800,000 sword-wielding warriors, and in Judah there were 500,000 soldiers.(2 Samuel 24:9)\n\nThey are from exactly the same time, but cannot be reconciled even allowing for some rounding.\nIn the past2 I have speculated that there may have been 300,000 men in a reserves force, and the different words used (soldiers vs warriors) may be purposeful. Similarly, perhaps an additional tribe has been added to the numbers of Judah in 2 Samuel 24:9 — we are told that Levi and Benjamin were not counted in 1 Samuel 21:5–6, and we can speculate (without evidence) that one or both of them were counted in the account in 2 Samuel. It is almost always possible to construct some explanation, although sometimes they stretch credulity.\nA few verses later in 2 Samuel, David buys some land:\n\nBut the king said to Araunah, “No, I insist on buying it from you! I will not offer to the  my God burnt sacrifices that cost me nothing.” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty pieces of silver. (2 Samuel 24:24)\n\nThe parallel account in 1 Chronicles tells a different story:\n\nKing David replied to Ornan, “No, I insist on buying it for top price. I will not offer to the  what belongs to you or offer a burnt sacrifice that cost me nothing.” So David bought the place from Ornan for 600 pieces of gold. (1 Chronicles 21:24–25)\n\nIgnoring the different names for the vendor, was it 50 pieces of silver or 600 pieces of gold? It simply is not possible to reconcile the two accounts in a way that convinces anyone except a believer immune to contrary evidence.\nGleason Archer’s Encyclopedia of Bible difficulties attempts to reconcile many of these contradictions, and provides what he thought were the most likely explanations. On this one, he suggests (p.190) that David actually bought the entire mountain from Ornan for 600 pieces of gold, having earlier purchased just the threshing floor (with some oxen) for 50 pieces of silver. However, no evidence for this speculation is provided at all, and it is contradicted by the text. The only reasonable way to read 1 Chronicles 21:25 is that “the place” refers to “it” in the previous verse. To read it any other way is disingenuous, and reflects the desperation behind many attempts to preserve a consistent biblical record."

    "text": "What is more likely?\nAnswering apparent contradictions in the biblical record has become something of a game for apologists. Who can dream up the most plausible account that is consistent with the different biblical passages assuming that each of them leaves out some important details? Provided somebody can imagine some elaborate story that brings all the details together, the contradiction is deemed “answered” no matter how implausible the story.\nHowever, the question should not be whether the accounts can be reconciled with a possibly elaborate story, but what is the most likely explanation for the differing biblical accounts? Is it more likely that two parallel historical accounts should preserve such widely differing details, or that we are reading two alternative versions of an oral history that has changed many times in the re-telling over many centuries?\nPeople who believe in biblical inerrancy never ask that question, because they start from the premise that the Bible is historically accurate, and so they assume that any apparent contradictions can be reconciled. The only difficulty is finding the right explanation out of the many that can be imagined."

    "text": "Coincidences\nThe reverse of contradictions is coincidences. A popular line of evidence that believers will use, and which I have also used in the past, is to point to apparently “undesigned coincidences” in the biblical text. An example from my Way of Life book (p9) is the link between the Anakites and Goliath.\n\n\n\n\n\nNumbers 13:33 (KJV)\n\n\nThere we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants. And we were in our own sight as grasshoppers.\n\n\n\n\nJoshua 11:21–22\n\n\nAt that time Joshua attacked and eliminated the Anakites from the hill country … No Anakites were left in Israelite territory, though some remained in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod.\n\n\n\n\n1 Samuel 17:4\n\n\nThen a champion came out from the camp of the Philistines. His name was Goliath; he was from Gath. He was close to seven feet tall.3\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three passages, written by different authors at different times, harmonize perfectly. At the time of Numbers, there were giants in the promised land, the descendants of Anakites. When Joshua went on his genocidal rampage, almost all of the Anakites were killed apart from those in Gaza, Gath and Ashdod. Much later, in the time of David, we find a giant living in Gath.\nThe argument is that such alignment across different passages written at different times is unlikely unless the passages are historically accurate. Certainly, if three different authors produced such alignment independently, that might be impressive. But no-one is suggesting that. Even believers assume that later authors knew of writings of the earlier authors. But more problematic is that historians consider all of the books of the Bible to have been written much later than the events they record, and are based on various oral traditions that had developed over time. It is hardly surprising if those oral traditions lead to similar elements appearing in different texts.\nThe huge men of Gath and neighbouring towns could easily have led to a mythical history that made its way into the books of Numbers and Joshua. All we can say is that the books are consistent with a belief (held at the time the books were written) that there was a race of giants whose descendants included Goliath3. Whether that belief had any historical basis is a different issue.\nWe cannot assume the historicity of the text, and then use the same text to argue for its historicity, especially when there is good evidence that it was written much later."

    "section": "Copying errors",
    "text": "Copying errors\nThere are many examples where the text appears to have been copied inaccurately. These are often corrected in modern translations, but the problems exist in the best Hebrew and Greek manuscripts.\nFor example, 2 Samuel and 1 Chronicles describe events in David’s life, and they do not always agree. Compare the following:\n\nDavid became famous when he returned from defeating the Arameans in the Valley of Salt, he defeated 18,000 in all. (2 Samuel 8:13)\n\nAbishai son of Zeruiah killed 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. (1 Chronicles 18:12)\n\nWe could probably explain the change of name by noting that Abishai was a general in David’s army, and so was acting on David’s behalf. But the switch from Arameans to Edomites is a simple copyist error. In Hebrew, Aram is spelled ארם while Edom is spelled אדם‬. Look carefully to see the difference. It would be easy to write the ‫ד‬ carelessly, or for the tiny stroke to the right to be smudged or fade, and then it looks like ‫ר‬. Some translations correct Arameans to Edomites in 2 Samuel 8:13 to avoid the apparent contradiction. There are many copyist errors like this in the Bible.\nBecause this causes problems for inspiration, it is common to argue that inspiration only applies to the original manuscripts which no longer exist, and that such errors are not God’s fault. That raises the question as to why God has not bothered to preserve his words more accurately if they matter to him. Presumably it would have been easy for him to ensure that the words were copied correctly over time, but he has not done so. He has not attempted to ensure the transcription of his scriptures are accurate, but he has allowed human errors to occur."

I asked myself that question, and I could not come up with anything that was sufficiently convincing for me to continue to be a believer."

In contrast, many modern societies still allow excrement to be dumped in the street, despite the practice causing serious illnesses such as cholera, dysentery and typhoid. Again, the argument is that this law demonstrated an understanding of science thousands of years ahead of the rest of the world.\nHowever, the rest of the world at the time was not so primitive. Ur had latrines leading to cesspits before 2500 BC; some parts of the Indus Valley had a primitive waste treatment plant well before 2000 BC; while in Crete, King Minos had flushing toilets around 1700 BC.34 The Exodus took place no earlier than 1450 BC, more than a thousand years after the latrines of Ur.\nThe surprising part is not that the Israelites buried their waste, but there are still parts of the world where excrement is not buried. The knowledge of good waste management seems to have been discovered and lost many times in the course of human history, and the Israelite practice is just one example of a period and place when good hygiene was practised. But it is not unique, and it is not the earliest."

A husband who suspected his wife of adultery could bring her to the priest and she could be forced to drink water mixed with dust from floor of the temple. If she subsequently experienced a miscarriage (Numbers 5:27)5, then she was assumed to be guilty, and would become barren. (Strangely, she was apparently not subject to stoning which was the preferred way of dealing with adulterers; Leviticus 20:10; Deuteronomy 22:13–24.)\nThere was no similar law for unfaithful husbands, although the Jewish writer Maimonides claimed that the traditional rabbinical view was that both the woman and her adulterous partner would spontaneously die at the same time, provided that the cuckolded husband was not himself guilty of anything similar.6\nThe floor dust of the temple would have contained dried blood, dirt, ash and possibly animal excrement, walked in by the priests who handled the various sacrifices. Presumably anyone drinking a potion containing such dust would be likely to become seriously ill. It may even have acted as a crude abortifacient.7\nThis practice reflects similar magical rituals from other cultures. In Nigeria, the Efik Uburutu people used to administer a poisonous bean known as “esere” to people accused of witchcraft.8 Those who died were assumed guilty, while those who survived were held to be innocent. The Israelite magic dust is no different from the Nigerian magic beans. Neither can determine the guilt or innocent of the accused, and both reflect superstitions about illness."

If someone wrote something today about events that happened in the early 1970s, and said that was a good reason to believe that a prophet in the 1970s was genuine, I would be highly skeptical. The time gap between events and gospels is a big problem.\nBut the evidence is even more flimsy than that. Although there are four gospels, it is obvious that Matthew, Mark and Luke are not independent. Most scholars think that Matthew and Luke are heavily based on Mark. So we do not have four gospels records; we really have two independent gospels plus two that are revisions/extensions of the first."

The “golden rule” of Jesus (“treat others as you would want them to treat you” Matthew 7:12) has also been taught in almost every other ethical tradition1. All these other ethical traditions and religions did not copy from Jesus — some of them pre-dated Jesus. Rather, they all came up with the same basic principle because it makes sense: human societies generally work better when we treat each other in the way we wish to be treated ourselves.\nIt was not because Jesus told me to be nice to other people that I have always tried to treat them well. Rather, it is an obvious human value — my life is much more pleasant when people are nice to me, therefore it is a good idea if I am also nice to other people. Most of us learn this by trial and error in the first few years of our lives, regardless of the religious teaching we are exposed to.\nSurely no Christian would claim that they refrain from murder and rape simply because the Bible tells them to. Every human society has discovered the value in respecting and protecting each other. In fact, it is not even a human value: herds of wildebeest do not need a holy book to tell them to look out for each other, yet they still do it.\nSo at least some aspects of what is often claimed as “Christian morality” or “biblical morality” are simply values that we have adopted because social groups work better that way.\nWhen an occasional person refuses to cooperate in this social contract, the society develops tools for enforcing good behaviour. One such tool is religion. The wrath of God, or some kind of divine punishment, becomes a threat that can be used to keep people in line: behave or go to hell."

    "text": "Non-universal values\nThere are other aspects of what is usually accepted within the framework of Christian morality that are clearly not universally held, particularly around sexuality.\nPost-Christian and non-Christian societies often have no objections to consensual sexual relations between unmarried people, or to homosexuality, or to other forms of sexuality that appear to be prohibited in the Bible. Yet only traditional sexual relations within marriage are allowed within the Judeo-Christian religious tradition. Presumably God, or at least those people who invented him, thought that it was best that way. But why?\nPart of the answer is probably associated with children. Early societies needed population growth for security and welfare, and they also needed those children to grow up in stable households where they would be cared for and educated. By restricting sexual relations to heterosexual married couples, the likelihood of a steady stream of children growing up in stable functional households is increased (although unfortunately not guaranteed). Making it a religious rule increases the pressure to conform.\nThe advent of cheap and accessible contraception means it is now possible for people to enjoy sexual relations with little chance of producing children, and consequently the social and economic need to restrict sex to married couples is diminished.23 In addition, we no longer need population growth for security and welfare, and so the need for children is reduced. As a result, traditional Christian restrictions on sexuality are being increasingly ignored, even amongst church-going youth.4\nThis is one of the few aspects of morality where my views have changed. The traditional Christian perspective is that homosexual practice is sin, and homosexuals should remain celibate (although the Bible passages are open to some dispute). Now I am somewhat embarrassed to admit that I once shared this perspective. After I stopped believing that the Bible came from God, I no longer had any reason to object. I am sorry that my previous attitude must have hurt my homosexual friends and acquaintances.\nSimilarly, the Bible appears to state that pre-marital sexual relations are sinful. Again, the relevant passages can be disputed, and as usual the Bible is not as clear as it is made out to be. Nevertheless, I accepted the traditional Christian perspective, and actively taught young people to wait until marriage. While I would still encourage proceeding slowly, I have no reason to object to consensual sexual relations as part of a committed relationship.\nOn the other hand, I still think adultery is wrong, not because the Bible says so but because it breaks a promise to one’s spouse. I am faithful to Leanne because I love her, and I want to live with her for the rest of my life, and I promised that I would be faithful. Far better reasons than simply following the advice of an archaic book.\nIn general, people are happier, and society is more stable, if couples are in long-term sexual relationships5. Marriage is still the best way of achieving long-term committed partnerships between two people (of either sex)."

Christians ignore, or explain away, these unpleasant parts of the Bible, and emphasise the nicer sections about love, mercy, kindness, and so on.\nThroughout the Old Testament, God orders the killing of innocent people. For example:\n\nHe drowns almost every person and animal on earth (Genesis 6–9);\nHe kills a man for not impregnating his sister-in-law (Genesis 38:9–10)\nHe kills all the first-born children in Egypt because of Pharaoh’s stubbornness (Exodus 12:29–30);\nHe kills an entire family (men, women and children) when three men question Moses’ leadership (Numbers 16:20–35);\nHe kills 14,700 men with a plague because he was angry that the Israelites complained (Numbers 16:41–50);\nHe orders parents to kill their children for being stubborn and rebellious (Deuteronomy 21:18–21);\nHe orders the destruction of 60 Canaanite cities, including the death of all men, women and children, to make room for the Israelites (Deuteronomy 2:31–35; 3:6–7; 7:1–2; 20:16–17; Joshua 10:28–43);\nHe orders the genocide of the Amalekites (1 Samuel 15:2–3);\nHe kills 70,000 innocent people because David conducted a census (1 Chronicles 21:1–14);\nHe kills 42 children for mocking an old man (2 Kings 2:23–24).\nHe kills 70 men for looking into the ark of the covenant (1 Samuel 6:19).\n\nRape and sexual slavery is not only condoned, it is sometimes commanded, and rape victims are punished:\n\nA man is allowed to sell his daughter to be a concubine (Exodus 21:7);\nThe towns of Canaan have a choice of slavery, or rape and pillage (Deuteronomy 20:10–14);\nMoses commands for all the virgin women of Midian to be raped (Numbers 31:14–18);\nFemale captives can be raped after one month of captivity (Deuteronomy 21:10–14);\nEngaged rape victims are killed (Deuteronomy 22:23–24);\nOther rape victims are forced to marry their attackers (Deuteronomy 22:28–29);\nGod promises to help with rape and plunder (Zechariah 14:1–2).\n\nClearly, what we regard as Christian morality is not derived from the Bible.

    "text": "Good without God\nI hope that these lists of appalling Bible atrocities are enough to convince anyone that our morality is not derived from scripture. So where do our values come from? I think we all accept a set of values independent of our religious beliefs, although we may not realise it.\nLong ago, Plato argued (in Euthyphro) that we cannot depend on a god to tell us what is good. He asked whether the commands of a god were good simply because a god commanded them, or whether the god recognized what was good and gave commands accordingly.\nIf something is good only because God commands it, then it is meaningless to assert that “God is good”, and anything can be considered good if it happens to take God’s fancy. If God has no reasons for his commands, then religious morality has no anchor; the resulting morality is arbitrary, capricious and irrational. Instead of commanding us to be merciful and kind, God could just have easily have commanded us to be nasty and cruel. On the other hand, if God makes commands because they are inherently good, then there is some other determination of goodness independent of God.\nAs a result of evolution, we are naturally social creatures. We have learned to survive through cooperative behaviour, and so we form communities. The same is true of other great apes and some other species. Young chimps do not need a Bible to tell them to honour their elders and refrain from killing their siblings. They even show altruistic behaviour. When leopards attack a troop of baboons, older males have been seen to engage the leopard in a suicidal fight while the younger members can escape. Acts of self-sacrificial love are not unique to Christians, or even to humans. Evolution has equipped us with the good sense to look after each other for the benefit of all.\nThe same evolutionary process makes us very sensitive to the emotional status of our companions. Therefore, our personal happiness is greatest when it is shared — nobody gets any real pleasure being happy in the midst of sad people. So we maximize our personal happiness when we seek the happiness of our companions.\nIn summary, a consistent and objective foundation of morality is this: Behaviour that contributes to total human happiness is right, while anything that diminishes total human happiness is wrong. As a result, I think we should seek, whenever possible, to increase the happiness and decrease the suffering of other human beings. I do not need a God, or a holy book, to tell me that. I can be good without God.6"

But we remind you that\n\n“It is a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the Living God…”\n\nand\n\n“Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, let not the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches, but let him who glories, glory in this, that he understands and knows me, that I am the Lord who practices steadfast Love, Justice, and Righteousness in the earth, for in these things I delight, says the Lord.”\n\nIf you choose to proceed down that broad path to destruction, then we hope you enjoy the few remaining years of your life, because that is all you will get.\nOnly those who repent, and humble themselves will be truly blessed. Turn around and come home, before it’s too late.\n\nPresumably this made the writer feel better, but otherwise it was rather pointless. Defending the Bible using references from the Bible is such an obviously circular “logic”, that even the writer acknowledges that he is wasting his time.\nOn one thing I can agree — I also hope that I enjoy the remaining years of my life. One unexpected consequence of becoming an unbeliever has been the increased awareness of my own mortality, and a heightened desire to try to enjoy the time I have. I am consciously enjoying the wonder of living more than I ever did as a believer: I am taking more time over meals, savouring good food and wine; I have attended more theatre and watched more movies, some thought-provoking, some entertaining, some uplifting; I have spent more hours engaged in conversation with family and friends; I have travelled to more places, experiencing the pleasures of other cultures and other places; I have spent more time playing cricket, and have become an accredited cricket umpire.\nOf course, I could have done all those things while I was a believer, but I chose not to. Instead, I spent my time teaching classes, giving talks, writing books, and organizing church functions, because I thought it was an investment in the future. The good times would come eventually, in the next life. This life, I thought, was to be spent working for God. I’m glad I discovered a better life.\n\n\nMessage 2\n\n\nI read with dismay your article “An end of faith.” You are wrong to make your confusion so public. Why do you do it? One noticeable feature of your meanderings is the emphasis on you. It’s foolishness, pride and self destruction.\n\n\nI do regard myself as a friend of yours, for so many years and through some lovely times. A shared faith does that for us.\n\n\nYou say you are an unbeliever. What a wasteland! What emptiness! What nothingness! What is human life all about? What do you hang morals on?\n\n\nYour criticisms are so condemning. We all know that nobody lives up to the standards they set themselves, but neither did Jesus’ disciples, and what an example they had.\n\n\nRob, there are examples of people (e.g. David) who over long periods have distanced themselves from God. God drew them back by love and forgiveness. That is what God is like.\n\n\nRob, try humility, lay out your fleece as Gideon did. God will answer your call. You have lots of worldly knowledge, competence and success. It’s not mixed with Godly wisdom.\n\n\nYour words “the attitudes to women and foreigners … of the God I once believed in” indicates a judgement on God that would make me think you have not come to grips with “the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.”\n\n\nYou certainly need a rethink,. But not from a starting point that says “I am right.”\n\n\nFaith cannot grow in the soil you have been busy producing, yet without it where are you?\n\n\nPlease think again, Rob. If there is anything I/we can do to help please feel free to give us a call.\n\n\nFaith, hope and love still abide. Search for them, in greener pastures. Open your heart as well as your mind.\n\n\nWith much love,\n\n\nSeriously? I need an open mind? And I need to start without an assumption that “I am right”? How on earth did I manage to discard three decades of belief if I did not have an open mind, and if I was not willing to accept that I could be wrong? As for humility, I can assure all my readers that to admit that I have been wrong all these years does not do wonders for my pride. Frankly I can think of better ways to stroke my ego. I could have pretended, accepted the invitations to travel the world as a speaker at Bible schools, and lived a lie. It certainly does not feel selfish and proud to have made a different choice, but it does feel honest. I was somewhat flabbergasted by this email as the criticism it contains missed the mark by so much.\nLike many Christadelphians, this writer would much prefer me to have questioned my faith privately and quietly, because then I could have no influence on anyone else. But the same people applauded and encouraged me for being so public about my belief on my university website, and for making all my religious books freely and publicly available online. You can’t have it both ways.\nThe “fear of the Lord” is used here to prevent free thinking and independent examination of the evidence for faith. “You must not question because God will zap you.” The residents of North Korea are kept in check with the same argument — Kim Jong Un knows what you are doing and will punish you if you dare question or criticise him. Surely a God with any real power would not be so insecure.\n\n\nMessage 3\n\nHello Rob, I guess you are receiving other messages like this which hopefully will show the concern of so many. How very unwise to divorce yourself from God, to put it mildly. If you need proof of His existence we have the nation of Israel..Isaiah 43:12. We have the evidence of the risen Christ..2 Peter 1:16. We have the marvel of creation..Psalm 139:14. Have you thought how much collateral damage this will do? Your immediate family will suffer and then the ripple effect to every other Christadelphian family who hears will take place, when one member suffers the whole body suffers with it. We are on the verge of Christ’s return, we need to be making ourselves ready for that momentous event.\n\nI’ve dealt with these supposed “evidences” earlier in this book. As for the collateral damage, I am far more worried about the damage of false hope and wasted time spent on religious activities rather than doing something more productive.\nThe implication here appears to be that I should have just pretended to believe for the sake of others. For people who believe that Jesus taught honesty and condemned hypocrisy, it is strange that they would suggest hypocrisy over honesty in practice. What kind of community encourages people to fake beliefs in order to maintain a fictional harmony? Not one I want to be part of."

    "text": "In contrast to the letters in the previous chapter, most of the messages I received expressed sadness, love and friendship, for which I am deeply grateful.\nI have very few comments on these. What can I say? I feel sad too. I have stayed in touch with most of these writers, and they remain dear friends even though we no longer have a shared faith.\n\nMessage 4\n\nJust read your latest blog post … firstly wanted to say that I love and respect you and always will regardless of what you call yourself now But secondly you made me cry today … and for that you need a clip over the ears! Waaaah. Ok, end of telling off. Love to you and Leanne … tough times ahead probably for you both and the family. Thinking of you xxx\n\n\n\nMessage 5\n\nI have just read through your blog Rob and feel so sad and emotional. You have always been so special to me all your life and especially your enthusiasm for making the scriptures live. I am aware you have done much soul searching about changing your way of life but I do want you to know how much you are in my heart. I will always love you both … I know we shall grieve the loss for a long time but will have many happy memories of the journey we have shared with you.\n\n\n\nMessage 6\n\nThank you for writing down some of your thoughts to help us understand why you no longer feel you can be part of us in Jesus. Thank you for your honesty and sharing your journey to authenticity. We hope that as you continue your journey you will find your way back to your spiritual base, your true home, in your own time. Although you may not feel part of us at this time, you share so much “family” values like integrity, truthfulness and kindness. You are still our brother, and loved, and respected for all you are, and in your good work in Jesus in the past. You do not need a “label” of believer, non-believer, etc. You are Rob and that is good enough for us.\n\nThe couple who wrote this remain good friends, and I appreciate the genuine love they have shown me. However, like many people who wrote to me, this message assumes that my “true home” is part of the church, and that somehow I have become lost and I just need to “find my way back”. I wish my readers would try to grapple with the evidence in a meaningful way, rather than immediately assume that they are correct and I have simply gone astray. My true home is wherever the truth lies.\n\n\nMessage 7\n\nRecently I read your computer blog and felt so much for you. As you stated, 95% of your social life was Christadelphians and I wondered who would “walk beside you” now. I experienced a very painful disapproval/disfellowship many years ago, so I appreciate the pain of aloneness in courage and separation you may feel just now. Whatever direction you take from here, be wise, cautious and hasten slowly. Your fellow traveller and cousin in life’s journey.\n\n“Hasten slowly” was good advice that I have tried to follow. It is now more than two years since I rejected my former beliefs, and I have not joined any other groups, made any other life-changing decisions, and only recently have I started to give away most of my large collection of biblical and theological books. I wanted to be sure that I was comfortable with the decision first.\n\n\nMessage 8\n\n\nI am sad to hear that you have left the Christadelphian community, but sadder still to hear that you now consider yourself an unbeliever. There have been many times when I have considered, is there a God? Not so much in the academic sense but more so in the emotional sense. I can only wonder that in your research examining the beliefs of our community you have forgotten that there are many things that God has not revealed to us nor will reveal until He is ready to do so, presumably at the return of His Son to this earth.\n\n\nThe problem you are now facing is that if you do not accept the reality of God, then you will not find Him in creation, in prophecy, in the lives of people, or the book that He has caused to be written.\n\n\nIn pursuing research to give credence to belief, I think you have forgotten about faith, “the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen”.\n\n\nI am not an academic and struggle at times to come to terms with my lot in life, but one thing I know, that without God and His Son I would be most miserable. I encourage you to continue to search for the truth, but bear in mind that the truth will not be found in the ways of mankind.\n\nThis letter was from a friend who has suffered deep personal tragedy, and his faith has been a support and comfort to him during the times of darkness and despair. This, perhaps, is the greatest benefit of faith — it gives people hope when there seems to be no hope, and alleviates the misery in times of suffering.\nHowever, I find it odd that one has to “accept the reality of God” before it is possible to find him. Faith becomes self-supporting with circular logic. Parents use the same argument at Christmas — “Santa won’t come if you don’t believe in him” — to encourage their children to pretend to believe in a charade.\n\n\nMessage 9\n\n\nAlthough I don’t know the reasons for your decision I really empathise with you because I have felt similar doubts over the years. The prime reason I am still around is the support of those I love and who love me within our church. They reflect the character of a God I sometimes struggle to see.\n\n\nRob, you have ministered to so many over the years, why not let them support and love you for a while. Don’t cut yourself off but just come and let us nurture you for a change. I don’t even mean in a “religious” way but purely as good and faithful friends.\n\n\nOur practice of the gospel has many flaws but, leaving aside the multitude of questions that arise from our particular take on Jesus’ teachings, the overriding feature of ‘love above all else’ is so worthwhile if only in a secular way.\n\n\nForgive my ramblings but, spooky as it may seem, I sat down to write to you last night (before I knew about your letter) but couldn’t find the right words. I’m still not sure I have but please accept them with all the love and goodwill that I can muster.\n\n\nI’m not good at listening but will try if you ever want to unload.\n\nGod be with you.\n\nI was touched by this message, not just because it was from a dear friend, but because it showed genuine empathy and understanding. Many people stay in a church because of the support and social network it provides, and because their friends are there. For many years I think I was unwilling to seriously consider the evidence for Christianity because I did not want to give up the benefits and enjoyment that came from being part of a religious community full of people I genuinely like.\n“Love above all else” is a great creed to live by, regardless of one’s religious persuasion. Many Christians claim this as a specifically Christian tenet, or at least one that requires some kind of religious support. But in reality, many unbelievers and atheists would agree. Love underpins the values and morals of almost everyone, as I discussed in Chapter 15.\n\n\nMessage 10\n\nHi Rob, So sorry that life’s journey has taken you through some challenging times. I can only imagine what you must have been going through these last few months, especially when it was only in May that we got to spend the weekend with you. Just know that we value your friendship and appreciate your honesty and courage.\n\nThis letter was from one of the organizers of a Bible study weekend that I spoke at a few months before my resignation. That weekend was difficult for me and I wanted to pull out several times leading up to it, but I didn’t want to let anyone down. Then I felt such a fraud while I was there. On the other hand, my wife and I had a lovely time with some wonderful people. So it was a very mixed weekend for us — we really enjoyed it, but by that stage I knew it was probably the end of the road for me. As it turned out, it was my last Bible study weekend.\n\n\nMessage 11\n\n\nwanted to drop you an email to let you know how much your decision is affecting me personally. You are a friend, part of my history … Lots of interwoven stories, some good and some bad.\n\n\nI have always admired your intellectualism and your wisdom, the way you research and then share those thoughts with the wider community. You have a graciousness that doesn’t intimidate even the simplest person which is quite astounding. Intellectuals are famous for coming across as quite arrogant beings at times. Selfishly I also feel very sad that I won’t get to hear you expound on those thoughts any more. There have been tears in my eyes.\n\n\nI wonder about your perspectives on faith and worry that you might have missed the point because you are so focussed on your evidence based research.\n\n\nTo me faith is not intellectual or based on intensive research. If Christianity was going to only appeal to those with high IQ or those that have access to research resources, then faith was never going to be in the picture and I think that’s probably the challenge for people like yourself, that they can accept the “simple” message that the gospel offers.\n\n\nI understand and respect your decision though it’s caused me great angst and ultimately to re-evaluate my own beliefs and where I sit in the “whole” of our wider community.\n\n\nYou will beat me hands-down for any evidence based arguments I put up so I hope you realise that’s not the thrust of my message here. My simple message is one of a faith that provides hope and a trust that God has my life sorted as indeed as the creator He has all life in His hands. I hope you can respect that.\n\n\nIt seems that people have a lot of different reasons for believing. For this friend, it sounds like belief flows at least partly because of the hope it provides, and the meaning it creates. Some people believe because those they trust tell them to do so. For others, it arises through experiences they cannot otherwise explain. For some, it just feels right. For me, belief in anything comes because I think there is sufficient evidence. I don’t believe the Quran because I don’t think there is any evidence. I used to believe in the Bible because I did think there was sufficient evidence, but then I changed my mind. I do not expect other people to have the same approach to belief, and for those who are happy believing for other reasons, I respect that.\n\n\nMessage 12\n\n\nWe have been terribly saddened by your announcement last week. There will no doubt be many, who are much closer to you personally, who have already had communication with you, so please don’t feel compelled in that context to acknowledge this additional one.\n\n\nThere is some irony in what follows. We have enjoyed over many years your studies, your writing, your graciousness, humour, love. The “Way of Life” was something that became “staple” for us in helping others to understand God and His ways while on mission work, and you helped us at that time to make use of it. Your earlier work on “Learn to Read the Bible Effectively” notes was also ground breaking. Because we still use these tools, that you’ve provided, we wonder what has happened to the dear brother in faith, who gave many others, “reasons to believe” and increased the faith of others? They were so simple, they still are. For fishermen, farmers, carpenters—they are easily understood, but so too, for lecturers, surgeons, engineers. They will continue to be used effectively in bringing others to faith in the grace of God and the companionship of His Son.\n\n\nI have mixed feelings about my books being used for proselytising. The Way of Life involved several contributors, and I do not feel that I can withdraw it from circulation when other authors are involved.\nYes, my works provided some easily accessible “reasons to believe” — cherry-picked evidence to bolster the faith of those wanting reassurance. They were written sincerely, as I too was fooled by confirmation bias. I wanted to find support for my beliefs, and I was prepared to overlook the problems. This book is partly intended to correct the record.\n\n\nMessage 13\n\nWe have been friends for just about as long as I can remember, and I hope and pray we will remain so to the end of our days. You are a person I have always admired for your honesty, so even though I feel tremendously sad about the decisions you have made, I see your honest spirit shining through, and am happy to be friends with a man who follows his conscience and beliefs (… or non-beliefs!) with such openness. Some live a life of hypocrisy in order to remain comfortable with their friends and family. You have chosen the harder road of being totally honest and risking losing many many life long friends. Thank you for being an honest man, not a hypocrite.\n\nThank you for saying so."

    "text": "Understandably, a lot of my religious friends have said they are praying for me. I would have done the same when I was a believer. It was my instinctive response to any problem, and even after I came to the view that God was probably imaginary, I would still find myself occasionally wanting to pray when faced with difficulties. It is comforting to think that someone else might deal with the problems.\n\nMessage 14\n\n\nHey Rob. Well it’s taken me this long to digest your sad news and to pull my self together enough to write to you — even now I am tearing up. I have always respected you spiritually and have felt that I have been on your wavelength in the way you viewed our faith and community, and as a result I use your books/articles in my Sunday School class regularly.\n\n\nSo it’s hard to believe you don’t believe any more … my prayer is that you will find your faith and feel the reality of God again.\n\n\nWhen someone says they are praying for me, I understand that they they care about me, which I appreciate deeply. However, such messages bother me because they fail to show any appreciation for my position. I do not believe there is a god. I do not believe he or she answers prayers. I do feel sad to be separated from my faith community, and I feel grief to have lost part of me that was once precious. But I would much rather people find something more useful to do with their lives than praying to a non-existent deity.\nImagine my left leg had been amputated. Then if someone was to tell me that they hope I will be back running again soon, it is not only unhelpful, it is somewhat offensive. I feel a little like that when someone tells me they are praying for me.\nOn the other hand, it is nice to know that my friends care enough to spend time praying for me.\n\n\nMessage 15\n\n\nI just wanted to let you know how much you’ve been in my thoughts and prayers this week. I feel so very sad about your loss of faith and subsequent resignation but I also know it would have been incredibly difficult and not a decision you would have made lightly.\n\n\nI have always respected you and your amazing knowledge so I would never attempt to persuade you in one way or another. I just pray that you can find hope in this hopeless world, where mankind can never solve the enormous problems it faces and can never attempt to save this beautiful planet from the destruction it has already caused.\n\n\nI sincerely hope that you are shown kindness, love and respect from the Christadelphian community. I also hope that you will always feel welcome at Ringwood and can’t think of a reason why you shouldn’t attend any function you wish – I will always be happy to see you there!\n\n\nYou will continue to be in my thoughts and prayers.\n\n\nActually, I do not find the world hopeless. I think we can save this beautiful planet from destruction, and we can create a better world together, but we do need to change some behaviours such as our reliance on fossil fuels, our addiction to economic growth, and the nationalistic attitudes that lead to wars, terrorism and abuse of refugees. Unfortunately, the Christian habit of emphasising the problems and failing to contribute to solutions is unhelpful. Just hanging around until Jesus comes to solve all the problems is not constructive. Surely it would be better, regardless of what we believe, to be actively working to make a better world now.\nChristadelphians have a very uneasy relationship with politics. Officially they are apolitical, not voting in elections, not standing for political office, and not getting involved in political protests. On the other hand, they seem to take more interest in politics than almost any group of people I know, and Sunday night lectures (the traditional but out-dated form of proselytising) frequently involve political commentary on both local and international issues.\nI was never completely accepting of this position, even while a Christadelphian, and my public comments on this issue led to me being banned from speaking at many Christadelphian ecclesias and functions.\nNevertheless, I had never voted until four years ago, and I had never participated in any political events or protests. One of the arguments used to support the apolitical position of Christadelphians is that all the problems of the world will be put right when Jesus returns to earth, and we should leave it to him rather than interfere in a process which is controlled by God. However, as I do not believe Jesus will return to earth, and I do not believe that God is in charge, it seems both negligent and irresponsible to stand by and watch elected governments damaging the country in which I live.\nConsequently, a year after becoming an unbeliever, I found myself attending a protest march for the first time in my life. The issue was the Australian government’s appalling treatment of refugees, and in good conscience I felt I had to say something. So I marched, with several thousand other people, to let the government know that we felt that its refugee policies were immoral.\n\n\nMessage 16\n\n\nYou have been on my mind all week, and although I don’t know you very well, I care very much about the decision you have made. I have read your latest musing many times and the replies that have followed in the last few days.\n\n\nI am not eloquent like most of the writers, but I just wanted to say Rob that even if we didn’t have the Bible, we only have to look at the perfection, design, beauty and order in every part of nature to know that there is a Creator and His mind is above our mind.\n\n\nSometimes things don’t seem fair to us, but in the whole scheme of things God only wants to save us. Without God we are nothing. What is the spark of life that flows through us and through every living thing?\n\n\nWe have so much to be thankful for, so many blessings in our lives. Who do we thank if we don’t believe in God?\n\n\nI know you will have had many emails this week and that is because people care about you. My prayer for you is that your faith will grow again. You only have to put your hand up to God for Him to take it. He understands your dilemma and He loves you.\n\n\n“Who do we thank if we don’t believe in God?” Why do we need to thank anyone? Life is wonderful, and the universe is extraordinarily beautiful. I am delighted to have this opportunity to enjoy it all. But I do not believe any god is responsible for it all, and so I do not feel compelled to thank anyone for the privilege of life.\nAs for reaching out to God, I tried that for years. I prayed every day, I pleaded with God to make himself known to me. Yes, a benevolent god provides some meaning to life, but he is imaginary. He provides the same comfort as my childhood teddy bear, and has the same level of understanding."

    "text": "A lot of people have assumed that something awful must have happened to me, or that all the criticism directed at me has had some cumulative effect that has hurt my faith. It is not like that. I just don’t believe it, and I did not want to spend the rest of my life pretending otherwise.\n\nMessage 17\n\nI know you have taken a hammering for having opinions different to some of the more traditional ones and I have to say some of them I share … but having them shouldn’t have made you a target for people’s fear. I am sorry for the treatment you have received and hope that these people haven’t forced your hand so to speak.\n\nIt is true that I received more than my fair share of criticism and opposition, especially in the two years before I resigned. To some extent, anyone who makes dissident views public is going to receive some kick back. Despite the official line that Christadelphians are free to think and believe as they choose outside of the strict definitions of the agreed statement of faith, in practice the Christadelphian community is prone to silencing the dissidents or at least making their lives very uncomfortable. I knew that, and I was well aware of it before I chose to write a blog exploring some alternative perspectives on the Bible.\nI am a professor, and I am used to robust discussion of different perspectives, even heated defence of alternative points of view. In fact, when I attended Bible classes as a believer, Leanne would sometimes gently remind me that I was “not at work now” and that I should be more restrained in pointing out the flaws in what other people said.\nSo when my fellow Christadelphians objected to things that I had written, it really did not bother me. I was careful to avoid some topics that I thought were too “hot” for open discussion, but I was prepared for opposition, even condemnation, on other topics.\nNevertheless, many people have assumed that my resignation from the community, and rejection of Christianity, had something to do with the sustained campaign against me from within the Christadelphian community. That assumption is wrong. My journey to unbelief was an intellectual process, and a rational decision. It was not an emotional response to the somewhat hysterical reactions to things that I wrote.\n\n\nMessage 18\n\nHi Rob, I suppose I am only one of many of your friends who have been saddened by your crisis in faith. I have often wondered about my own faith and sometimes felt as spiritual as my bootlaces. I have also wondered whether our community encourages a social baptism, based on head knowledge and the ritual of joining a social club. Many church counsellors have described Christadelphians as having it ‘in the head, but not the heart’. You are not alone with your questioning. I would say that every good christian from time immemorial has questioned their faith and challenged God. I believe this is essential for truth to be found and for us to really know what is in our hearts. Often we find that an experience in life seems to evoke an unexpected response from God and we feel confused or betrayed, let down or left alone. I do not know what experience you have had to have left you feeling this way. You have been an inspiration and mentor to many and I can only pray that maybe God is using this time to help you look deep into yourself and find Him in your heart.\n\nSeveral people made this assumption: that only a deeply distressing experience could have led to my unbelief. I’m glad to say that is not true. However, I have looked deep within myself. What led me to my decision was a long careful look at why I believed what I did, and what evidence there was for anything that I believed. I became an unbeliever because that is where the evidence led me. It was not a position in which I wanted to end up, but nor was it a position I came to because I was fleeing something else. Like it or not, I am an unbeliever because the evidence strongly suggests that the Bible is a book written entirely by men thousands of years ago, and that God (if he or she exists at all) has no personal interactions with human beings.\nI suspect that people would prefer me to have suffered some terrible trauma because then there would be a more palatable reason for my unbelief. It would be easier to be able to excuse it as the result of some dreadful personal experience, then to have to face the lack of evidence for the Bible and for its God.\n\n\nMessage 19\n\n\nSo sorry to read your blog. You obviously have no idea how serious a mistake you are making. I don’t know your situation but you are clearly under a pressure in Australia which hasn’t reached the U.K. yet. I know that it will. Will Christ find faith when he returns? You know the words. Clearly a rhetorical question to which the answer is ‘no’ or at least ‘very little’. Does that mean that it’s all wrong. Just as clearly ‘no’. The evidence is compelling (to me, if not to you) that the way the Christadelphians understand things is as near correct as perfect. Of course, we do not judge how merciful the Father will be on incorrect belief. Our behaviour is all important. We leave the rest to the Father.\n\n\nA final thought: you cannot resign from baptism any more than you reverse circumcision.\n\n\nThis one was from someone I do not know and have never met. Again, I can only assume that people like to imagine that I was “under a pressure” because that helps them explain my unbelief. Many letters have ignored the fact that my unbelief is a result of a careful consideration of the evidence. Nothing more. I simply looked at the evidence as carefully as I could and came to the conclusion that I had been following an empty delusion all my life.\nWhen someone expresses such dogmatic certainty, it makes me wonder if they are desperately trying to convince themselves rather than me."

I am sure there is weeping in heaven over your choice. Please remember that if you have a change of heart, your heavenly father is waiting with open arms to welcome you back, as are your brothers and sisters.\n\n\nPerhaps we can get too clinical with our Bible studies sometimes. Perhaps if we read God’s word and let it speak to our heart and let it become part of our very being, so God and Jesus dwell with us and affect every thought and action in our lives, it is a healthier situation.\n\n\nGod doesn’t need people to prove he exists. He is creator. How can there be a creation (by whatever means) without a creator. How can a dress or a pair of trousers come into being without a designer and maker? Even if you leave a length of fabric and a sewing machine on the same table, how many trillions of years would it take for chance movements to cause a garment to be constructed? It’s an impossibility.\n\n\nHow much more can the absolutely mind boggling creation we are part of, come into being by blind chance? The amazing complexity of DNA and cells shouts of a designer far, far greater than the people so totally reliant on the intelligence and design that has gone into DNA and cell structure. To think that these incredibly complex and intricate things just happen, beggars belief. Whether people believe in him or not, makes no difference to God’s ultimate plan, although the effects on those who don’t believe will be catastrophic.\n\n\nPerhaps it is sometimes good to step back from a situation Rob, so you can see it more clearly. I know you consider yourself an unbeliever, but I would hope you would not shut your mind to the possibility that you have made a mistake. God can open our hearts to listen to him and I pray that at the right time, God will open yours.\n\nIf God requires no evidence for his existence, can the same be said of the tooth fairy, for example? How can there be money in the tooth jar without the tooth fairy? Whether people believe in her or not makes no difference to the fine work she does, although the effects on those who don’t believe will be poverty and misery. The circularity of the argument sounds silly when applied to the tooth fairy, but we have heard it so often for God that it might start to sound reasonable until you stop to examine it.\nIn any case, the comments above on creation show a lack of understanding of evolution and natural selection. No scientist believes it is “blind chance” or that things “just happen”. This is the straw man argument that creationists are so fond of. If you want to debate the issues, at least take the time to understand them.\nQuite a few of my correspondents suggested that I needed a more open mind, and that I should allow for the possibility that I had made a mistake. Of course I could have made a mistake. After all, I now think I have been wrong about God and the Bible for my whole life. Perhaps I am still wrong, but I think I am less wrong than I used to be.\nBut the charge of needing a more open mind is bizarre. It is not possible to change one’s entire worldview without being prepared to step back, think carefully and keep an open mind. Unfortunately, those people asking me to have an open mind do not seem prepared to follow the advice themselves.\n\n\nMessage 22\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I’m sure, and hope, you have received many caring emails and messages from your brothers and sisters since your honest confession of your “End of Faith”.\n\n\nI read your Musing not long after you posted it and immediately drafted what I hoped would be a thoughtful response. I still remember being in my hotel room and pressing the post button and thinking it was all done.\n\n\nA few hours later when at work I noticed that for some reason it never posted. I tried again and once again because of some technical gremlin it failed. And then I had a prevailing thought that I was not meant to post whatever was in the message. For me that thought, that idea, came from another place — another Power — God’s Spirit.\n\n\nI decided then that at some time I would post something but I believed that God wanted me to say something different to you. That was some time ago and, to be honest, being the forgetful character that I am, I had quite forgotten about that.\n\n\nUntil I started preparing for an exhort this afternoon and started thinking about a lot of different ideas and thoughts. Mostly they were captivated by my views on what Faith truly is and I remembered the title of your blog — “An End of Faith”. I once lost my Faith — I described that moment in a series of talks I gave called “Finding Faith”, when my second son was dying in hospital after having lost my first son. I had an end to faith, but I’m not sure that at that time I even knew what faith was. Since then I have started a journey called Faith and it is just that — a journey and a long way from finished.\n\n\nThe biggest thing I have learnt is that Faith is not the same as belief and that doubt is not the opposite of faith. And this is why I would love you, and I know you are a VERY VERY busy man with family, work and other commitments, to take just a short bit of time and do the following:\n\n\nStart FIRST by saying a prayer to whoever or whatever could be out there to help you as you read the gift I have sent to you.\n\n\nPlease then read some of, or even better all of, the Kindle book, Benefit of Doubt1, I have sent to you for download — you can use a Kindle or read off your Browser. It was only released this month but in many ways reflects so much I have come to understand about faith.\n\n\nThird — hopefully as you reflect on all your experiences with “God” and the events of your life and as you bring them into the context of all the doubts you now have, perhaps you might agree — “My belief is in tatters, but my Faith is not yet ended.”\n\nI did everything this correspondent requested — I prayed, I read the book, and I thought about my experiences. The book argues that we should not seek certainty, but should embrace doubt. The author defines faith as “trusting in the face of uncertainty”. I never thought of faith in any other way, so the book did not offer a new perspective for me.\nI would never say that my journey in faith was finished, or that I was certain about where I am. In fact, as a statistician, I rarely have certainty. Instead, I look for sufficient evidence to support some hypothesis. The more limited the evidence, the more faith is required. Statisticians reject a hypothesis when there is insufficient evidence to support it. In this case, the hypothesis is God, and the evidence is lacking.\nThis correspondent makes the statement that “Faith is not the same as belief and doubt is not the opposite of faith”. I agree. Faith is the bridge spanning the gap between the evidence and belief. Doubt is a healthy acknowledgement of the uncertainty in almost everything we believe. I have always had doubts, but I also had faith. I became an unbeliever when the chasm between the evidence and belief became too wide for the bridge of faith to span.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActually, two people sent me the same book: G. A. Boyd (2013). Benefit of the doubt: Breaking the idol of certainty. Grand Rapids, MI, USA: Baker Books.↩︎"

    "text": "A few of my correspondents wondered about my future. What would I do now I was no longer writing books and giving talks about the Bible? Would I start an atheist crusade with the same energy and enthusiasm I once gave to my preaching? Others wrote to me a few months after I had resigned, asking how I was getting on.\n\nMessage 23\n\nI know that you feel as though you have had an epiphany and that you can finally see the ‘truth’ clearly, but from my very simple perspective, it looks more like you have been blinded as a result of your intelligence … that you have had your nose in the books so long that you have forgotten to look up and see the evidence of God all around you. No one would question that you are a very intellectually smart man but from what you have written it just seems as though you have over-analysed everything way too much and have put all your trust into your own ‘wisdom’, yet not in your heart. You set out to justify your faith in God (and obviously failed because it made you an unbeliever), yet faith in God is one of those things we can’t justify, it just is.\n\n\nChristadelphia is not perfect and unfortunately one of our biggest flaws is that we too often put our favourite speakers on pedestals. We look up to them and we idolise them. This will be true of you too Rob. There would be many people out there who would look up to you and listen to all your views because you are an intelligent man. I know you intend to throw yourself into disproving the Bible soon using all your new-found “unbeliever energy”, but can I suggest that you sit on it for a bit? You’ve just started this new path in your life so I realise that you’re pumped and want to change the world, but you really need to take a minute to think about the fall-out.\n\n\nThink about it this way. If we Christo’s are wrong and there is no God and we don’t wake up after we die … then who cares? Have we hurt anyone by giving up our Sundays to go to Church every week? People can choose for themselves — it really shouldn’t matter to you! But if you go ahead and write your book and condemn our faith and try and prove to people that God doesn’t exist then all you’re achieving is killing hope in those that would be guided by you. You may think that you are giving them the gift of freedom or whatever, but really you are taking something wonderful away from them. And like I said, if we’re wrong then there’s no harm done … but if you are wrong then the damage you could do to other people is insurmountable. Do you want to be responsible for taking people away from their faith?\n\n\nRob, please look into your own reasons for wanting to disprove the Bible and the existence of God. Is it to convince yourself more? Is it to draw people away from their belief in God so that you aren’t so lonely on the “outside”? I really want to challenge you to take a year off … to get your nose out of the books and to stop over-analysing and over-thinking everything and try and take a new perspective. You’ve already chosen a new life for yourself, so maybe give yourself 12 months of “chill-out” time. No reading … no writing … Just spending more quality time with your family (I hate study for that reason alone — it takes time away from family) and go and see if a world without God is what you want it to be. I personally couldn’t go a day without talking to him and would feel helpless and depressed if I didn’t have Him in my life! Please just try and hold back on your crusade for a bit. You may feel differently again in another year.\n\nSo many unfounded assumptions and confident assertions about how I feel and what I intend to do. And this person has never even met me!\nI’ve given myself two years before writing this book. There was lots of “chill-out” time and I’ve hardly written or read anything about the Bible, faith, or belief. I have spent a lot of time with my family. I never intended to be on a crusade, and I have no plans of starting one now.\nWhen writing my blog, I had no intention of disproving the Bible, or the existence of God. Quite the contrary. I wanted to explore the evidence for God, and for the Bible, and was somewhat surprised when I found it so limited.\nI did not write this book to persuade my Christadelphian friends to give up their faith. I wrote it to explain to my friends why I left, and why I think it is important to have faith supported by evidence. If they choose to continue to believe, that’s fine with me. If my writings lead people to re-examine, and ultimately lose their faith, that is their choice.\nIt is now more two years since I stopped believing, and I’m more convinced than ever that I made the right choice. I am only sorry that I did not realise my mistake earlier.\n\n\nMessage 24\n\nI guess I would be interested to learn about your experiences since resigning in part because our oldest daughter has lost her faith. We’ve known this was coming for some time, but because she lives [elsewhere], we don’t get many opportunities for face-to-face communication. However, during a recent visit she and I had a long talk and she told me that she has no faith any more. She doesn’t rule out the possibility of God, so I guess she is an agnostic. But she doesn’t feel that she has any capacity for belief. This has been very hard for us and has led to a lot of tears. But we are trying to maintain a good relationship with our daughter, even though one thing that connected us is no longer there.\n\nThis was part of my response:\n\nThe main issue is time. The Christadelphian community spends a great deal of time together, and tends to fill all available evenings, weekends and vacations with activities. This has two effects on the community — it provides ready opportunity for regular interactions with other Christadelphians which strengthens the community bonds, and it prevents opportunity for interaction with non-Christadelphians, even family members. So if you want to maintain good relations with ex- or non-Christadelphians, I think the community needs to spend less time together and more time fostering interactions outside the community. That is probably a recipe for a healthier community as well.\n\n\nA second issue is expectation of change. I have noticed that many Christadelphians seem to think that I would change in some way. I think they believe their own propaganda — namely that values and morals are a consequence of holding the true doctrines, so if you lose your faith you are destined to become a heinous sinner. I don’t believe there is a nexus between belief and morality. As long as the belief that morals flow from doctrine is maintained, there is a barrier to interactions with non/ex-Christadelphians.\n\n\nYou say that one thing that connected you with your daughter is no longer there. That’s true for me too. My parents and most of the wider family are Christadelphians, and I no longer have the link of a common faith with them. Predictably, I don’t really think that is so important any more. They have also been exceptionally supportive, regardless of whether they agree with my change of heart. Perhaps there was some fear that my loss of faith would cause a rift in the family, but no such thing has occurred. Family bonds should be stronger and deeper than that.\n\n\nSpend time with your daughter and do fun things together. I’m sure you’ll find the relationship is not so reliant on a common faith as you imagine.\n\n\n\nMessage 25\nThis was a very long and eloquent email, and I’ve broken it into sections in order to respond to various points raised. Unfortunately, some of the eloquence is lost in the break-up.\n\nI received your email more than 6 months ago now, and have returned to thinking about it many times since. It’s still the most unexpected personal news I’ve heard in a while — and that in a pretty strong field, it has to be said!\n\n\nI was quite startled, and most certainly taken by surprise, at receiving your note. I awaited your final Musings post, and was intrigued to find that you had come to conclusions on a range of topics that we had discussed previously, and on which you had (or had at least valiantly attempted to!) provided sufficient reason to me to come to the opposite conclusion.\n\n\nI remember coming to your house once upon a time with 33 (I think) questions, which to my mind were very difficult, and which you and Leanne made a fine fist of answering. I can’t locate the list now, but I do recall that quite a few coincided with questions that you have addressed yourself in your blog over recent years.\n\n\nSo it has taken me a while to collect my thoughts about your news. I suppose also that you were most likely overwhelmed with correspondence of varied and exotic flavours at the time, if the comments online are anything to go by. In any case, here is mine, and if you have baskets into which these are mentally sorted, I hope it lands at least a little way away from the nuttiest end.\n\nI tried for many years to answer the sort of questions this person raised, both to myself and to people who came to me with doubts. But over time I began to feel that my answers were desperate attempts to paper over the cracks in the evidence, rather than satisfactorily resolving the issues.\n\nFirst of all, I think you are very brave. As you pointed out, voluntarily leaving a community in which you have spent your entire life is a big deal. Leaving it on the basis of a push factor, viz a viz no longer being convinced of some of the key tenets, as opposed to the pull factor of a “better option” of some sort, and thus not having the welcoming bosom of any other kind of community or interest group to land upon, is a very big deal indeed. And as other commentators have noted, Christadelphia is a “High Commitment” community, accentuating the contrast between life in and life out. So, hats off to you for having the courage of your lack of conviction.\n\nIt doesn’t seem courageous to me. I feel that I had no choice — I could not continue to attend religious services that are based on mythology and archaic cultural conventions, feeling like I was a fraud. Once I decided I didn’t believe, I tried fronting up for a few months and I felt terrible. It was even worse giving study weekends. For a while I was planning a quiet fade into the back row, but even turning up was too hard. There is no room in the Christadelphian world for people who do not believe, or who are unwilling to fake belief.\n\nSecondly, I am impressed by the certitude that underpins this bravery. While I can relate to your doubts, and I can relate to your questioning, and I can certainly relate to your impulse for exploration and re-examination, I find it a little harder to relate to the apparent conclusiveness of your lack of belief. I have found myself for a long time in a place where it is very difficult to believe some of the things which we might be supposed to believe, but neither can I believe in the completeness of an alternative proposition in its entirety. So I am intrigued and impressed by the certitude of the conclusion upon which you have taken such difficult action, particularly as it is a conclusion of absence rather than a conviction of presence. I appreciate your distinction between “agnostic” and “unbeliever”, but to land upon either and act upon it is admirable boldness.\n\nI was in a position of doubt for a long time — a few years. But it suddenly struck me that there just wasn’t enough evidence to justify belief. It is not that I’m certain about athiesm. But I’m fairly certain that the Bible is uninspired, and that the key Christian doctrines are false. Perhaps there’s a God. Who knows? But if there is, he/she/it isn’t bothering to communicate with me, so there isn’t much point worrying about it. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life spending enormous energy on something I don’t believe. So I figured I better leave rather than hang around. If I had stayed a cultural and attending Christadelphian, but without the belief, I would have found it too difficult to maintain the lie and lack of authenticity. There are plenty of people who do that, but it’s not something I am prepared to do.\n\nThirdly, I think you are an enormous loss to the Christadelphian community, and in my opinion, to thinking religiously-inclined people of all persuasions. My state of equilibrium is helped to be maintained by the existence of that minority of people who are willing to honestly confront and answer the difficult questions, and you have been one of those people. Furthermore, you were one who publicly set out to do so by means of your prolific output, which will be missed by me, and I imagine by many others besides. You mentioned your quest to encourage reform within the Christadelphian community, which in my opinion is both noble and necessary, and also exceedingly difficult. Your departure will set back that cause, both in the loss of your immediate influence, and sadly also because I fear some will use you as an example of where asking too many difficult questions will lead. None of which is a reason for you to not follow your own conclusions, but it is a sad day for the community.\n\nI imagine my leaving might seem like a sad day for the community if you want the community to survive, at least in its current form.\nFrankly, I think the Christadelphian community cannot survive, except in its most extreme form. There are now too many educated members, and too much available information, for the mythology to continue to have any power. Even now it is apparent that many members remain part of the community for cultural and social reasons, rather than because of a deep-seated conviction of the truth of the core doctrines. But the culture does not have a sufficient hold on its members for it to be easily passed on to subsequent generations. Extreme Christadelphianism is likely to survive longer, simply because the cultural entrapment is so much stronger.\n\nFourthly, and somewhat related, is the question of what it means to be part of the community. [Someone] … said to me once that it was the best life one could have, and even if none of it was true it would still be the best. Having experienced some of your trajectory, and having considered and examined life outside the community, I understand his point. It is both the warm embrace of many good-hearted people, and in almost literal terms a family, given the continued progression of Christadelphia (at least in the Anglosphere) from a self-selecting group of believers towards an ethno-religious group with deep family ties. In that context, I really do wonder how many people fully understand, and/or fully believe, what might be considered to be the central tenets. There is an argument for membership of the community in its own right, specifics of belief aside. And if you did not have the certitude that I think you have, I would argue that you were fully within your rights to benefit from that membership for whatever period of time you wished, while allowing your new conclusions to ferment. It is your family at least as much as it is a group of believers with specific ideas, and in being a family it should be there for you even in these times.\n\nTrue, but being a Christadelphian does not come without cost. It is almost mandatory to attend at least weekly, and to go through the process of worship, to give public prayers (if you are male), to publicly profess or at least infer belief in the Bible, and so on. While I believed, I was more than happy to do those things; in fact, I welcomed them. But once I stopped believing, to continue to do them was to pretend to be someone I wasn’t. The cost in staying a Christadelphian was my authenticity and my honesty. I was not prepared to trade that.\nOn the other hand, leaving has come at a cost too. Previously I interacted with hundreds of other Christadelphians at multiple church activities every week, at regular Bible camps, at conferences in Australia and overseas. Now my life is much less social. While I have retained a few Christadelphian friends, inevitably I have not heard from most people since I left. I have not attempted to contact them either. Our lives have drifted apart as we have taken different roads.\nOne of the great benefits of a church community is that it provides a support network in times of trouble. I have seen this work wonderfully when people have been sick, or injured, or in some other difficulties. My support network is much smaller now, and is yet to be tested.\n\nFifthly, I remember saying to you that I thought maybe faith and reason were a continuum, and that therefore one was necessarily a trade-off for the other. You did a good job of convincing me that this is not the case, and that they are in fact different dimensions. Which got me thinking about your use of the word “unbeliever”, and whether there is a difference between faith and belief? You talked a lot in your note about conclusions reached by reason. Then you talked about how these conclusions equate to a lack of belief. I think you use the word faith interchangeably with belief in your post, but you don’t really talk about faith in the context of faith in God, faith in Jesus, and such like. I wonder if the two things are actually quite different, and while I would tend to come at “faith” in the same way as you on the basis that there are intellectual underpinnings that make it plausible, I suspect many people come at it from a very different angle which is simpler and perhaps closer to “pure faith”. But that is not to say that coming to faith from the direction of reason makes the faith itself any different, and you surely had faith. So I am curious whether, having reasoned that you do not intellectually believe in certain Christadelphian (or Christian) precepts, does it automatically follow that faith also recedes?\n\nI always held the position that faith was underpinned by evidence. I certainly had faith, and I believed that it was supported by some evidence. I now feel like the evidence I imagined was there was nowhere near as strong as I thought it was. Through a heavy dose of confirmation bias, and by deliberately ignoring the problems I knew were there, I was able to convince myself for a long time. Then for some reason I tried to re-evaluate the evidence as dispassionately as possible and for the first time faced up to the difficulties and acknowledged the lack of any convincing evidence. Without evidence, I have no faith.\nI realise that a lot of people (perhaps most people) never think about the evidence and are happy to just go along with an inherited faith. But that is so contrary to the way I think about everything, that I couldn’t really do it.\n\nSixthly, I’m sure I told you many times that inspiration cannot mean what most Christadelphians say it means! And I still agree with your new conclusion on the subject! But I still do not have a compelling alternative conclusion, so my state of equilibrium continues. I have not as yet found this position to be an insurmountable barrier to anything, neither have I found the orthodox Christadelphian position to solve any great problems in its own right!\n\nI guess I did eventually find a compelling alternative conclusion. Namely, that the Bible is a purely human book, reflecting the limited world view of an ancient tribal religion, and the perspective of an uneducated Canaanite people.\nThat is not to say there is no wisdom or beauty in its words. I love some of the meditative Psalms, the feisty reformist writings of prophets such as Amos, the introspection of Ecclesiastes, and some of the counter-cultural teaching of Jesus. But that does not make it inspired, just inspiring.\n\nFinally, I do not believe in a bunch of other things that I am probably supposed to. However, I do still believe that without a God it is difficult to make much sense of life. I don’t believe it for the reason that mountains are spectacular, or tigers are beautiful, although the sheer complexity of living organisms and natural ecosystems is something for which I would struggle to accept an explanation that does not involve enormous external intelligence. I believe it for sociological reasons, because I find that most of the arguments for anything sociological are grounded upon principles which I do not believe can intrinsically exist without a source of morality that is not relative. I follow the social and political dialogue of the day quite closely, and I just cannot see a way for to make it all add up without that external reference point.\n\nI do not buy the argument that morality and faith are linked. There are countless examples of faithful people doing despicable things and unbelievers acting with extraordinary love, compassion and selflessness. My moral outlook is the same as it ever was because it stems from my humanity, not from my religious belief.1. I do not agree that people naturally behave in a selfish manner without a religious brake to modify their behaviour.\nBesides, the Bible has many examples of God, and his people, acting in appalling ways that should be considered immoral by any measure. These incidents are conveniently overlooked in what passes for “Christian morality”, which is really just common human decency given a religious justification.\n\nI still follow that thought with another that says if God is out there, and our sociological progress is dependent upon something that he has instilled within us that is not evident in other creatures, then he probably wants us to know something about him or at least try to do so. Again, spectacular mountains and beautiful tigers go some way, but I find the sociological aspects more compelling. And for me, between the almost unbelievable story of the Jews, and the behaviour of people when they act in a way that would just not be “natural” in a purely physical world, I cannot refute that there is something there to believe, and which therefore stands in opposition to my lack of belief. I don’t know if this is the end of a journey for you, or the beginning of another, but either way I wish the best for it. I hope you will find other important questions to muse upon, and share those musings with the world. And I hope we will see you again before too long.\n\nI guess the real question for me is the last one raised here — can one make sense of life without a God? That is probably the most uncertain part of it all for me. I don’t know, but I’m trying it out. I have used God as an external reference point all my life, so it is rather different making sense of the world without that. Ask me in five years and I might have an answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one exception to this concerns sexuality as discussed in Chapter 15.↩︎"

    "text": "Several people contacted me to say they were going through a similar process of deconversion. I think it was comforting for them (and for me) to know that the journey need not be a lonely one.\n\nMessage 26\n\nI have similar questions, but it is hard for me to break away. I think it would be liberating but not sure I can bear the abject grief of my parents. So do I continue to live a lie? Not sure. Sometimes I teach Sunday School and I am almost cringing at what I am saying!\n\n\nAnyway, I hope you, Leanne and kids are all OK. Your blog has inspired me. I just need to find that courage to take it to the next step.\n\nThe cringing while teaching is what did me in really. I believed less and less in the words I heard myself saying, and eventually I felt unable to continue.\n\n\nMessage 27\n\nI’m not sure of anything anymore either. But I am hoping that one day I can be sure again, of something at least. Or maybe I’m just a bit scared of making a decision …Anyway, all I wanted to say was ‘Hi’ and ‘I get it’ and that our friendship remains regardless. All the best.\n\nUnfortunately the Christadelphian world is a difficult place in which to have doubts. You are supposed to be certain of what you believe, and if you are not, you are supposed to just pretend! Some faith communities are much more accommodating of unbelievers, and do not require every member to express certainty in God’s existence and in the Bible as his word. I might have hung around a little longer if that option was open to me, but I think I would have soon left in any case. Despite the warm friendships I enjoyed through the church community, the empty nonsense of worshipping an imaginary deity is too mind-numbingly pointless for me to willingly endure.\n\n\nMessage 28\n\nI believe I’ve been going through a somewhat similar experience to you over the last few years, & I know I’m far from the only one. I was relieved to read your blog. It’s been so hard trying to “fit in” while striving to be intellectually honest. Thanks for making me feel better about the conclusions I’ve made.\n\nI’ve discovered that there are many unbelieving Christadelphians who remain part of the community for social or family reasons. Some struggle to find an intellectually honest explanation for what they believe, but many just feign faith in order to remain part of the social network which the community provides.\nIt is sad that it is necessary to act out a faith when you don’t believe. While the confident assertions of God’s activity and purpose give the impression of a strong faith community, in reality they hide the many members who are plagued by doubts. It is a very unhealthy community that demands its members behave with duplicity and dishonesty in order to maintain the charade of certain faith.\n\n\nMessage 29\n\nHi, I was brought up in a deeply Christadelphian home, and I always thought that I would always believe, but lately I’ve been having huge doubts. I’m 18, and not baptised, and I don’t know how to go about bringing it up with anyone, because if I do, I get told to “search it out for myself”, which to me, kind of sounds like an excuse for not knowing. I read your most recent post, and a lot of what you said chimes with me, and I just don’t know anymore … No one I know in my meeting wants to talk to me about it, let alone understand it. I feel isolated from the people I grew up with, because they have always expected me to be the same as them: Finish school, get baptised, married, have kids, and continue the cycle. I find so many of the ideas in the bible archaic, especially toward women and homosexuality and submission and so many other things. I don’t even know why I’m emailing you, I just saw your post, and thought you might understand.\n\nI do understand, and I feel for people in this position. But at 18 years old, there is plenty of time to build new friendships, make new connections, and establish a social network that is not dependent on archaic beliefs and attitudes. I was in my mid-40s before I finally realised that my faith was built on an illusion. It would have been much easier to have left much earlier.\n\n\nMessage 30\n\nI was very interested in your change of beliefs and I was not quite sure what I myself believed. For a while now, I have known that our social values don’t originate from the Bible and that it was probably not inspired by God because there seemed so many contradictions. Also I found insights into his own morals didn’t add up because how could he be loving and just, then wipe out civilisations because they are not ‘his chosen people’?\n\n\nAnyway, I have read your last ‘Musings’ blog entry several times, spoken with xxxxxx, watched some videos by Richard Dawkins explaining the destruction of societies due to religion, and learnt more about evolution. It ended up coming down to me holding onto a belief in God and Christ because of one strange coincidence that happened to me 7 years ago, and not knowing whether the ‘warm fuzzys’ when attending church was the Spirit. I also felt the support and community of churches were important but I have not been in that environment for a while now.\n\n\nOn Tuesday it suddenly dawned on me that if I don’t believe in the Bible then that blew the idea of God out of the water because that’s the only documentation that speaks of Him. I know it has been said to me many times, including by yourself, but it hadn’t actually clicked properly until I read your last blog entry again. I think I have been holding very tightly onto Christianity because it has been a major part of my life until about 2 years ago and any other beliefs were too foreign.\n\n\nAs it is still such a new idea to me I feel very weird and don’t think I can quite say that I’m atheist but there is a huge amount of relief mixed in with weirdness because I now don’t need to constantly defend something that was not logical and had so many grey areas that just didn’t make sense. I also held very tightly onto the belief that good people live forever (regardless of their spirituality or religion) because 80 years isn’t long enough to spend with those you love. It has suddenly made me appreciate life to a whole new level because this is all we have and I want to do everything I can imagine. As for the support system, I have been attending activities to meet new people, and family are important, this is enough for me.\n\n\nI don’t know how you feel being a major influence on my self discovery, certainly something I wouldn’t have thought possible several years ago, but thank you.\n\nWhen I was a Christian, I had a strong sense of wanting to influence other people, to teach them the “truth” as I understood it. As an unbeliever, that has not been my intention, so it is somewhat ironic when it occurs!\nI think many people who leave Christianity go through the same questions as this writer:\n\nSurely a loving God would not behave like the biblical God?\nCan the Bible be inspired given its anachronisms and contradictions?\nAre those nice feelings I have in church due to the Spirit or just an emotional response to the environment?\nAm I just holding on to religious beliefs because that is all I know?\nWhat hope is there if we have no life after death?\n\nI certainly asked all of those things, many times, before eventually rejecting religious belief. I also felt the strong sense of wanting to make the most of my life because it was a precious but short opportunity."

    "text": "This final collection of messages were from people who had already left the Christadelphian community, in some cases many years before me. I know very few of these people, but I appreciated their thoughtfulness in writing to me.\n\nMessage 31\n\nI bet you have been getting the emails lately, huh? Some pulling this way, some pulling that way?\n\n\nI can tell from the comments on the blog that there is a contest going on for the control of your thoughts and mind. Already there are some who think they know what you are thinking even more than you do. I suppose that’s to be expected when such an announcement is made on an Internet blog on the World Wide Web.\n\n\nMaybe it’s perplexing when you suddenly don’t believe something anymore and you wonder just what it is that you do believe? Where do you go from here, what do you do now, etc? That’s just part of being a mature adult standing on his own two feet. Nobody knows everything, nobody has ‘all the answers’, what works for one person may not work for another, and that’s just the way it is.\n\n\nWhat is a person to do but just accept things as they really are? After all, it is what it is and no amount of wanting or wishing is going to change anything in the least. It’s true that we can, and do, delude ourselves sometimes and even our memories cannot always be trusted.\n\n\nI bet you thought I was going to give you some sage advice or something, didn’t you? Well, I’m not. Because, you see, I’m just as subject to self-delusion as everybody else living on this planet. While I may try to always follow ‘the scientific method’, that’s not always possible — but it does keep one from going too far wrong. No, all I’m offering is just someone to talk to, with, if you care to do that. If not, well, I understand that too.\n\n\nBest wishes to you and yours,\n\nYes, it was perplexing at first wondering where do I go from here? It was lonely at times — lying in bed at night wishing there was a God I could talk to. Then I wondered about self-delusion — if I could believe an illusion for so many years, how could I be sure about what I believed (or didn’t believe) now?\nThere are comforts in religion that I did not appreciate when I was a believer: the feeling that someone else is in charge of your life takes away some worry and responsibility.\nYet, in the end, I am much happier as an unbeliever.\n\n\nMessage 32\n\nYou must be getting a lot of email traffic, so I’ll keep this short. I have come to the same conclusion a while back. I would like to know how you deal(t) with the impact on family. I was not raised in Christadelphian culture, but [my wife] has and really struggles with her parents’ probable reaction. Also, she finds the notion of self-determination difficult/threatening.\n\n\nI see the bible as a book reflecting the collective learning from a number of tribes and cultures. As such, it is a wonderful resource that does however have to be consumed and applied with great caution and within context (culture, science, etc). Christadelphian culture does not (and cannot) allow for that. I have also come to the conclusion that this is not a benign finding. Quite the opposite — it does a lot of harm to young people’s minds and their ability to appreciate people, cultures, and life for what they really are. It stands in the way of self-efficacy. The level of often unspoken but definitely tolerated, if not openly endorsed, discrimination and sexism frightens me. The hold Christadelphian culture has on people frightens me. The power ABs1 exert frightens me.\n\n\nI would enjoy staying in touch and please let us know if we can support you in your decision and the consequences (I have no idea what they really are) in any way.\n\nThe impact on family worried me the most. I had heard of several people in a similar position (both Christadelphian and in the wider Christian community) whose marriages failed and who became estranged from their children. I am deeply grateful to my family that my experience has been very different.\nAs explained in chapter 1, I tried to help my family and friends through the process by telling those closest to me first and given them time to adjust to the idea and ask any questions. They have all been wonderfully supportive, regardless of their own religious beliefs.\n\n\nMessage 33\n\nHi Rob. I told my parents last year that I hadn’t been a Christian for many years and they found it hard to stomach. When they asked me about my belief and whether I was an atheist/agnostic I used the video below2 to explain my position. It’s Neil DeGrasse Tyson and he describes himself as a neither an agnostic or atheist, instead a scientist. As a statistician you’re the ideal scientist.\n\nBeing a statistician forces me to always think about evidence, and I’m sure that is what eventually led to the demise of my faith. The evidence just didn’t stack up. I think most people never really look at the evidence, or if they do, they cherry pick to justify existing beliefs (which is what I feel I’ve been doing for the last 30 years!).\n\n\nMessage 34\n\nI applaud your decision and the manner in which you have gone about it.\n\n\nI was baptised at the age of 15 and like you, left after 30 years, leaving family, friends, marriage, a lifetime of study and commitment effectively behind. That was ten years ago.\n\n\nReading your comments, I think your analysis of what will happen to your friendships are pretty spot on.\n\n\nI have never once regretted my decision, I had no choice, I had become a charlatan as I no longer believed any Christadelphian (or for that matter any religious) position. I have found a need to move away from what the Psychs call “reaction formation” and ensure that I have not lived my life since as a reaction to all things Christadelphian. I think you are ahead of where I was already, as I sense no rancour, anger or need to prove the community wrong.\n\n\nSome of the former Christadelphians I engage with through Facebook are still very angry and hurt many years after leaving and I feel for their difficult journey. I take the position that there is so much to live for, so much to learn, experience, love, share etc. I owe it to life to embrace it all. I also celebrate that I had the courage to accept the flaws in my beliefs and let the evidence draw me to uncomfortable conclusions. My lack of faith was not a personal weakness, it was simply because there was insufficient reason to have faith.\n\n\nYou take with you your essential self with all its components, and I have come to realise that much that I did do in the community has had positive and good effects on me. Couple that with a profound sense that I no longer try to champion the unsupportable, it is all worth it.\n\n\nLike you I regret the pain I caused family and friends and I still live with that 10 years on. I occasionally meet up with old Christadelphian friends and they are generally kind in their reflections, and still keen to bring me back. I do not have a single significant friendship that has survived my departure, and I had virtually no connections outside of the community and outside of my profession. Good things come your way thereafter.\n\n\nSo many Christadelphians, including the most rabid zealots, have many good qualities also, and I see no good in demonsing individuals or the community. I sense the same position in you.\n\n\nTake good care Rob. Be kind to yourself over the coming months.\n\nWhile I have some regrets, being part of the Christadelphian community for many years was largely a positive experience. I’m not sorry to have left, but I also have fond memories of good times with great friends.\nI feel deeply sorry for those who suffered abuse of some sort within the Christadelphian community — and there are many who did. Leaving is so much more difficult, and so much more urgent, for such people. I am aware of the anger and hurt that many ex-Christadelphians have carried for many years.\n\n\nMessage 35\n\nI don’t think you know me but I have watched you from afar over the years.\n\n\nI remember when you wrote “controversial” articles for the Shield magazine many years ago. I have read your blog etc. with interest over recent years. I have often wondered how you managed to remain a Christadelphian and I am not surprised that you have finally left.\n\n\nI completely understand that you may have hurt people. One of my greatest regrets is that I could not shield my elderly mother from our loss of faith.\n\n\nI believe that you have done the right thing — the evidence for God is very slight.\n\n\nI said to a Christadelphian recently, who was very nice but questioned me extensively, “by the time you take all of the unbelievable parts of the Bible away, you are left believing in God simply because you want to do so”.\n\n\nIt is a difficult journey that you are beginning, I’ve been there. One of the most difficult things is to lose what I call “Christadelphian thinking patterns” — they are deeply ingrained and faulty. Don’t lose faith in yourself on the journey.\n\n\nLet me say again, you have done the right thing.\n\nI have been amazed by the great kindness shown to me by people I have never met, especially from those who have also journeyed from belief to unbelief.\nMy immediate family and friends have also been extraordinarily supportive, despite many of them remaining within the Christadelphian community. The last few years would have been unbearably difficult without them. Thank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArranging Brothers: the all-male management committee that runs a Christadelphian ecclesia.↩︎\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=CzSMC5rWvos.↩︎"
